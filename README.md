This code is designed for training a RoBERTa model using Amazon product review texts. We categorize the data into two types for different objectives: binary classification and five-way classification. To facilitate debugging, a smaller dataset is also available. Comprehensive analyses and results can be found in the Data_Processing_Analysis.ipynb file. Logs from the training process are stored in the `./logs` directory. The trained model can be accessed via the following links:
