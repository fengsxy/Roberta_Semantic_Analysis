This codebase is tailored for training a RoBERTa model on Amazon product review texts, with the data being segmented into two categories to serve distinct purposes: binary and five-way classifications. To streamline the debugging process, we've included a smaller dataset. Detailed analyses and outcomes are documented in the [Data_Processing_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/fengsxy/Robertaforsenmantic/blob/main/Data_Processing_Analysis.ipynb) file. Training logs are systematically archived in the `./logs` directory. For access to the trained model, please refer to the following links:
