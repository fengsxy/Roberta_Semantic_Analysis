One is that they are not the most attractive shoes. I'm always a little embarrassed wearing them out in public so I try to limit my exposure with them. Second is that the sole is not very solid so it wears down quicker than the average shoe. I often walk with them to pick kids up after school but our road is not paved, it's gravel so the rocks start to poke through the well-worn bottoms of my older Crocs.I was very pleased to find this style with a tougher sole in fact the entire shoe seems to be made of a more durable rubber. The shoe itself still has a wide toe-box but it's not as bulky as the 'beach clog' model. There are no holes directly in front of the clog either so that stones don't have a direct route in but there are still holes for air circulation.They are comfortable to walk in and seem firmer in support but still traditional Croc squishy comfort.Time will tell if they hold up after a lot of uses but this was a great price at $40 compared to the $49.99 retail price in a Croc store.", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "I wear a size 7.5-8 shoe.

I actually eventually LOST them during our last move. It's ok, I got my moneys worth! Plus I was tired of the color, the pair I had were a dark brown.I just got these in the redwood color with the soft footbed. I went for the soft footbed specifically because I recall, even after so many years, the rough break in period. These are comfy out of the box with the soft foot bed! Like a slipper. However I believe, I have no proof but I believe, that the soft foot bed will negatively impact the longevity of the shoe. I know the rubber on the bottom is replaceable and to some degree the cork is too from what I understand(I never had to replace the cork on my old pair though, if you replace the rubber before you hit the cork AND keep the cork sealed, you shouldn't need to) but I have no idea how the soft foot bed will affect repair or replaceability. My general guess is that it will wear out and need repair sooner. The redwood is a lovely color. I like it a lot because it's colorful enough to be interesting, but not so bright that it will clash or stick out.Sizing. I'll be honest, they are full of *you know what* on sizing. Back in 1995, prior to having two kids, the smallest size I could find in the store (this was pretty much pre-internet, I could buy it at the store or not buy it at all, ordering was difficult as the shoes were made in germany) was a 36. Back then, I was told a 36 was about equivalent to a 6-6.5. I was a 5. I purchased them anyway and they were very big on me. I didn't care, I just wore big fat socks with them. Ok, well time went on, I had two kids and my feet got larger.  I am now actually a size 6-6.5. Well when I went to order these I looked at the Birk size chart on the Birk website and it says that a 36 is equivalent to a 5-5.5 and a 37 was a 6-6.5. So based on that, I should have ordered a 37. And in fact every other pair of shoes I now own is a 6-6.5 or a 37 in euro sizing. I thought to myself that maybe over the years they had changed a little, maybe they ran smaller or something. Then I remembered they were a German company, not a US company, so I went ahead and ordered a 36. Bingo, they fit perfect. They are DEFINATELY a 6, someone who is a size 5 would be swimming in these shoes. I have wide feet so I did not get the narrow.Another really important note is that certain colors come with the soft footbed and other colors come with the classic footbed. They don't come in both options. So if you order redwood, it will have the soft footbed (at least as of right now in May 2012). The best way to know if it's classic or soft since you can't necessarily tell from amazon, is to hop on the Birkenstock website and see which color comes with which footbed.", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "This shirt is amazing and looks amazing on.

I have never gotten a synthetic jewel stone before, but this one caught my eye, so I got it for myself.  While not up to a real sapphire's beauty, it is very pretty.The necklace is a good length and hangs just right--not too low or high, just below the collarbone--and the synthetic, pink sapphire has sparkly facets that catch the light well.  It is a subtle and delicate piece of jewelry.It is also only $50, so this would be a great gift to buy if you are on a budget.  However, I would suggest looking into buying Swarovski jewelry if you are on a budget, too.  Some of it can be pricey, but you can find pretty pieces for around $50, and I LOVE how their crystals sparkle.  They're gorgeous!Anyway, the only negative thing I can say about this necklace is that the chain is VERY thin and weak.  You have to handle it with extra care, and while wearing it, make sure you do not accidentally rip it.  The chain can be easily replaced, if needed.I give it five stars despite the one flaw.", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "It's really pretty.

It has a very soft feel - almost like real leather. The color and design as advertised - sharp and pretty and bold for fall/winter. The inside is well made and holds your checks on the bottom flap, check register on the top flap and even an ID and 3-4 credit cards if needed.I also bought 2-3 OTHER types of checkbook covers from OTHER sellers at the same time to see what I would like best and they just didn't match up - vinyl looking/feeling product and less appealing to the eye. The more I checked them out, put checks/registers in and out and got a feel for them - the less I liked them. Just felt \"cheap\" and I knew they would wear out very quickly. Disappointing.On the other hand, the CAG product was clearly higher quality. The more I handled it, the better I liked the smell, feel, color and texture. I am confident this product will do well over time. In fact, I was so pleased that I ended up ordering a total of 10 of these items in all colors - pink, purple, green, blue, brown, etc. for the 3 accounts my husband and I have. Of course, some I'll use now and others I'll have for the future as they wear out and they need to be replaced.The price is very sound - better than many I have ordered direct from banks in the past that are easily 2x as much money. If you are into religious or inspirational sayings on your products- this line will be tops for you. I didn't really need that in my product, was more concerned with price/color/quality, but am pleased with the entire product now - sayings included.

Color is good since the boot looks good under slacks and is not obvious you're wearing a boot.  Warm, but not uncomfortable to wear indoors at a restaurant, etc.  The sole of the boot is thin and flexible enough so you can feel the ground underneath, which I've found is an excellent way to prevent slipping.

I'll update my review when I actually wear it.I bought this since my shapewear I got from Spanx wasn't really doing it's job. It made me look pregnant by bringing my lower belly fat up and out (this one goes to under the bra line). Could be small, but it's well within my weight and measurements, and people said that Spanx has the right fit- no need to get anything smaller or bigger. So I decided to go with Bali, it's a popular name and sometimes names that aren't so out there like Spanx do just a good job. I think this does a better job to tell the truth! I like the design A LOT, especially on the butt. My spanx one doesn't have so much control like this one. I bought this for a bridesmaid dress that I thought would be too small. The dress actually fits perfectly, and the materal isn't so thin. But this will really help smooth me out and make my butt look a little better. I have a pear shape, so my waist is small but my hips are wide. And unfortunately instead of having boobs I have this very large butt. So this is a must have if you have a big booty that doesn't fight gravity! Also very comfortable, material seems so much better than the spanx one I have. Will probably buy from Bali again, especially with the price I paid (about $12)! I wear a size 6 dress, and usually small-medium sized clothes. I bought a large, and it fits very nice.

The bra strap on this style is now a solid strap and they hold up GREAT.  NO MORE STRAP ISSUES ! ! !  The fit overall is somewhat tighter than the original JMS satin comfort bra but overall they fit really really well. I highly recommend these bras.  The Satin Comfort bras actually run larger as compared to other styles, so if you run larger in other brands and are difficult to fit with larger cup sizes, you may find better success with this bra.  Just look for the updated plastic packaging (instead of the old traditional thin box) and check the straps to be sure there is NOT a seam that runs lengthwise of the strap. HIGHLY recommend - I plan to continue wearing this style for many more years - the fit and feel is that great!For equivalency - This bra in sizes 40D, 40DD, or 42D fits about the same size as a Champion XXL Sports bra.Original review: I have been wearing this JMS 1960 satin comfort wirefree style of bra for many years. They fit GREAT - they are true to size and hold their shape well. The problem in the last couple years has been in the manufacturing process of the straps. Recently far too many of them have broken down - even in the first wearing or two - the straps then scratch and cut deeply into my shoulders. THE PROBLEM IS THE MIDDLE SEAM running the entire length of the strap.  When the material starts to separate (3-5 washings) the plastic comes through and CUTS into my shoulders.  I've had to throw away plenty of really new bras yet my old bras are fine. This is NOT a problem with older bras of the same style and size just a really bad production issue since about 2010 or thereabouts. Just be forewarned to check out the bra straps and be ready to return if you notice issues.", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "I was disappointed when the dress arrived that it was way too small but should have known that &#34;One Size&#34; was going to be a medium.

I wear a size 14 an I ordered a 1XL in black. After putting these on, I realize now I probably should have ordered a L or a M.  The elastic is very flexible and not the kind to hold itself forcibly against your body, like some elastic pants can, i.e. yoga pants.  I could easily fit another person inside these pants or at least a couple of beach balls if I were so inclined.  However, if I roll the waist up and wear a long shirt, they certainly work for hanging out around the house.  Plus, the length is perfect as I was constantly tripping over my yoga pants and these have pockets, which is nice.  So, in short, if you're looking for a comfortable, but not necessarily flattering pair of house pants or possibly something to exercise in, these are the ones for you and should order whatever size suits your fancy.  If, you're looking for a pair of lounge pants that you can also run around town in for a quick jaunt to the grocery store, I would suggest grabbing a size or two smaller than gut tells you.

Heavy boots wear me out, so I was looking for a shoe stable enough for the job.  Here's my take on this shoe after a couple of trips:The shoe fits me a little small.  I ordered an 11 and an 11.5 and returned the 11.  My usual shoe size is 11D.The lacing system is fantastic.  One pull and the shoe is snugged down around your foot.  The complaint from some reviewers that you can't &#34;spot adjust&#34; the lacing is baloney, because over a short distance any lacing system is going to self-adjust to equal amounts of tension throughout the lace anyway.  This just does it immediately.The rear of the foot opening is just slightly high on my ankle and rubs a little on my achilles tendon, but not to the point of discomfort or a blister.My only complaint is the sole.  It is not as thick as I would have liked for carrying a backpack.  I weigh 165 pounds, so with pack I come in at 200 pounds, and I can feel rocks on the trail through the bottom of the shoe.I have since tried another shoe, the Patagonia Drifter A/C Goretex, which is the same weight but with a Vibram sole, and I much prefer it's sole.  If you want a really nice hiking and trail running shoe I recommend the Solomon.  If you want a lightweight low-cut hiking shoe for backpacking, or if you are very heavy, I think there are others that are better suited for that, such as the Patagonia.", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "It's cute and unique.

Inside I was hoping for a large open space so that I could use my purse insert.  Unfortunately, it has a center zippered pocket which I am not a fan of.

After that I wore it less often, but not because of any specific issue, I just moved on to the newest and coolest watch. Anyway, I recently rediscovered this Seiko masterpiece in my case and I am really glad I have it still. Unlike the current issue model, mine has a Seiko Singapore movement, rather than a Malaysian movement. But in both cases, my understanding is that the watch is assembled in Japan using the same movement. So the precise origin of the movement's construction may not be a big deal. Anyway, mine keeps great time, given its cost. Obviously, it can't keep pace with a Casio Solar Atomic model, which is another favorite of mine, but it still is pretty accurate. I've worn mine all day for many days now and its accuracy is about +5 to 7 seconds per 24 hours. I think that's pretty good. And whatever concern you may have over the inherent inaccuracy of Seiko automatics versus general quartz movements, I will say that the absolute aesthetic beauty of this watch greatly outweighs them.

The ideal suits (ones that are thousands of dollars) are usually around 18-20% silk.  So, yes, this has slightly less silk but that's to be expected for the price.  Being able to even have this great fabric combination for this price is amazing.  Never buy a suit that has rayon as it's one of the cheapest suits you'll ever get.

Fossil stores will also gladly re-size your Fossil band for free, and change batteries for about ten dollars which includes labor and the actual battery.The CH2600 has a 10 ATM water resistance, which is about a depth of 100m. Some of the Fossil watches are only 5 ATM, so just be aware of the rating. The band is typical Fossil fare, with a single button depress that I absolutely love! It feels very sturdy and luxurious. Casio and Invicta metal linked bands always feel flimsy and cheap, like they belong on an inexpensive Timex at the department store. Watch snobs have regarded Fossil as being \"cheap mall watches\" but honestly, unless I am prepared to spend the money for a Citizen EcoDrive or Seiko, the Fossil line does almost the same job with about the same quality.The CH2600's second hand does not match the tick marks, but it is not a deal breaker. Doing research, many other premium movements may not have the seconds hand match up with the tick marks either. I noticed that Fossil watches tend to run about 3-4 seconds faster per month, and when they start to run slower, the battery probably needs to be changed. The chronograph seconds and minutes hands don't rest at the 12'o clock position, so I had to reset them by pulling out the crown to the 3rd position (adjusting the time) and used the chronograph buttons to adjust the hands.The tachymeter bezel is mainly for show, because the chronograph seconds hand does not run the circumference of the bezel so it can't be used to measure speed of an object.The CH2600 watch is polished stainless steel, while the flat surfaces of the band are brushed stainless. The polished surfaces can be scratched or scuffed more easily than the brushed surfaces.The crown is oversized but recessed, and does not catch on my pocket sleeves or clothing like it does with my CH2809. The CH2600 is noticeably thicker than my other Fossil watches, but it isn't significantly heavier. The band is slightly wider as well, but none of these bother me. The extra heft is actually a bit more assuring.The Fossil font is very attractive on the dial, and the text is all white in color with a black dial color. These combination offers great contrast and is noticeably refined, I'd recommend it with professional business attire as well as casual business attire.Overall: 4/5 stars. I've yet to be let down by Fossil and I have yet to find another brand that offers the same quality at this price point. There's a 11-year warranty on the movement, 10 ATM water resistance, and the wrist band is extremely well made. I would give it 5 stars if the big seconds hand could be used in the chronograph made rendering the tachymeter bezel fully functional, and if it were perfectly aligned with the tick marks.Would I buy another Fossil watch in the future?

I am a 7.5 normal and most all shoes in size 7.5 fits perfect. i can't do 8's, but i can squeeze my foot to a 7 depending on the brand. like the one i had gotten from bcbg, i was able to get a 7 (only because they did not carry my 7.5) and knowing that it was a leather, i expected it to expand over time, which it did (although i've had my pains). anyhow, i also want to mention that i have a long feet compared to most people, but nonetheless, 7.5 is my fit.after careful thoughts and contemplating what color and size to get, i purchased the natural base 7.5, which was cheaper than black and still very common color to wear. when i received, i tried them on immediately and was a bit disappointed due to the shoe being bigger than usual... the width and the back was perfect. it was the front that was a bit odd. i've actually asked a friend what she thought and she didn't think it was bad at all, but being that i spent $50 something dollar, i didn't want to feel what i was feeling. it had almost 1/2 or little more remaining on the front. not sure why this is the way it is, but it looked a bit odd and i decided to return it. i would have thought about exchanging for another size, but i walked about 12 feet across indoor, and heard the slipper slapping noise against my foot and that's when i decided this will have to go as i do not want to make too much noise or catch any attention with my shoe slapping noise...anyhow, i really liked the show. the wedge is perfectly sized and can definitely see that it's comfortable, but wasn't for me. if it had delivered with the size 7 the first time, i would have kept it... but i didn't want to risk the second unknown...", "label": "negative"}, {"text": "I wore these sandals the first day I got them and they fit like a dream.
