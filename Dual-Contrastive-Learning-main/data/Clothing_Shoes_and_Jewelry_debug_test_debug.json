[{"text": "I put this bra in my Amazon cart months ago while looking for a cheaper version of my favorite brand (Moving Comfort: Fiona). After deciding to stick with what works, I essentially forgot about this item until months later when I accidentally purchased it thinking I had saved a Moving Comfort.

The shoe is very comfortable and attractive.  I have not had any trouble with my feet, knees or back using this shoe.

My chest measures 47\" (chest alone) and 53\" ( arms included). The sizing info provided in this coat's page is NOT for this specific coat, so don't base your purchase on it. Do the following:Measure your chest in two ways:1. Raise your arms and measure around your chest at its thickest section.2. Lower your arms and measure around your chest,  at the same level as before, but this time including your arms (a bit bellow the shoulders); this measurement shouldn't be more than 10\" greater than the measurement from step 1; if it is,  go a size larger.Hope this helps.", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "I love this shirt!!!

This makes it just about impossible to get your foot in and out of the shoe and once my foot struggled in these two low laces basically strangled the top of my foot.  The rest of the shoe feels awesome the toe box is wide and roomy and the heel is low but these two stupidly designed laces make this shoe unwearable for longer than a couple seconds on my foot.

Although the dimensions of the bag may allow you to fit these things, the pliability of the material and lack of padding makes items in the bag vulnerable to damage.

Of course I quickly learned that minimalist shoes shouldn't be worn 5 days a week and especially not on every pavement run.The saddest thing though was the fact that the place these shoes were the worst was on trail runs. I took them for daily runs on gravely fire roads for a week and by the end of that week what little cushioning I had was smashed flat providing NO shock absorption. The mesh on the sides had torn open allowing pebbles to leap into my shoes and the rock plate was doing next to nothing to protect my feet.

You will bounce when running or exercising, but not horribly, and the fabric between the straps in front prevents 'overflow' (the dreaded bra-line cause by top edge rollover as the bra stretches over time and your girls try to escape their confinement) and diminishes the 'uniboob' effect that nearly all sports bras like this one seem to create in larger sizes.

Now these are my favorite hiking shoes!", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "Like most women, I've owned many a brand of bras in my lifetime. Glamorise is consistently my favorite, far better-made & more comfortable than Playtex (another company that caters to plus-size women like me, just as one example). While I've tried to give other bras a chance, especially considering that Glamorise bras are a bit more expensive, I always return to this brand. The production standards are high. I have yet, out of the more than thirty pairs I've owned, to see a piece of loose elastic, torn lace, pilling or other signs of low quality from this brand- even after years of use. As a rule, Glamorise bras are supportive, well-stitched & have a long lifespan. I always wash my bras in a mesh, zippered laundry bag, on the delicate cycle, in cold water only, with liquid Tide. I then air-dry them, carefully folding them before putting them away to keep the cups preserved in their proper position. My bras last two to three years this way, typically- sometimes longer.This particular bra stands out as the most comfortable that I've ever owned. It is very soft, feels wonderful on the shoulders, and the band is so cushy- while I don't believe in wearing a bra to sleep in, if you're into that, this may very well be a great choice for you. I love it when I see that I've come to this bra in my \"rotation\", simply because it is so comfy to put on! I could stay in it all day & night- it's like a second skin. The cut, for this brand, is quite ample- the shoulders, the cups, the band, the back...plenty of fabric, plenty of stretch, lots of give. There shouldn't be any spillage at all, as long as your correct size is bought. This is the rare Glamorise bra that you don't have to go up a band size with- and you may actually want to size DOWN on the cup size, because they're rather big. If you normally wear a 46DD, for example, a 46D would probably do very well for you. If you've found other Glamorise bras to be too constricting or tough, even if you bought your correct size, you may indeed prefer this bra over others in their line. It really depends upon what your personal preference is- superior comfort with some support (this bra) or very firm support, with comfort being somewhat secondary (which would categorize most of their other bras).I have to remove a star for the lack of support this bra gives, even for just day-to-day living. I would definitely not wear this to workout, especially for high-impact exercise (though this is not a sports bra, and is wisely not marketed as such). Compared to Glamorise's Women's Sports Bra (my favorite bra of all time), this is more comfortable- but the support is NOWHERE near the level of the other bra. I'm not a teenager, but I'm not old, either. At my age, I can still get away with wearing this type of bra, but if I was sagging much more, it just would not be supportive enough. There is little \"lift\" from this, and keep in mind that means less stress will be removed from your back. If you have a large bust that causes back pain or sloped shoulders, this is important to bear in mind. Unless you have great posture naturally, you're very young and/or firm, I don't think one would look especially \"perky\" in this bra. It's not that it's cut too big, or cut incorrectly- again, it's just designed to give soft support, not protect the chest against high-impact activities. Also, the wide straps may be undesirable if you prefer to wear ballet-style, sweetheart or portrait necklines- the straps can peak out of those shirts very easily. As I usually wear polo shirts, this isn't an issue for me, but I thought it should be mentioned. I wish that this bra came in more colors, and especially, that it came in black. The Cafe color is fine for me to wear under white shirts with no show-through, as I'm Caucasian- but if you're a lady with darker skin, Cafe may be too pale for your liking. White is okay, but of course there is more of a chance that it'll show through clothing, especially in photographs, in bright sunlight or under thinner tops. And since this is a more full-cut bra, black would be a nice color to minimize the size of the bra- the lighter color emphasizes how full the cut is. However, the size range is much better in this style, and I give kudos to the company for that.", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "I needed this tool set specifically to remove the backing off a watch in order to replace the battery.

Of all the G's we own, this is right up there with my favorites, and I wear it often.  It actually sees more wrist time than my G9300 since it is smaller and wears lighter, I like the way it wears.At first, I was not as satisfied with the function buttons - originally they were difficult to push as some have clearly stated in other reviews.  However, I am not sure if they have loosened up over time, but they don't seem to me that they are as hard to push as when the watch was new.  I operate the buttons now without thinking about it and without much difficulty now.  Like I said, I am not sure if it is because I got used to them, or they have worn in and loosened up - it might be a little of both.  Although they are not as easy to push as the other G's I own, it is not that big of a deal.As far as functions - I bought the G9000 Mudman due to it's reputation of having one of the better G modules out there - and in my opinion it has lived up to that billing.  Two stopwatches, a countdown timer, International timezones, four alarms, snooze, a nice bright, easy to push light and more....  Plus, I like the way this reads compared to other G's in normal lighting - it has a bright face, and reads well in all lighting conditions.  The letters, date, etc are all easy to read too - even for my old eyes!  Many other G-Shocks have certain parts of the face that are not easy to read- like the date on some models, but on this Mucman due to the display brightness, font used, etc I like the way it reads and have no trouble with it.The only \"con\" I can think of is the \"2\" used in military time - it is a little \"squashed\" due to the way it is displayed.... a minor thing, but it is a lame looking \"2\".Others have complained about the nubs on the back being uncomfortable when wearing the watch for extended periods - I have not noticed that, and I have used it for woodworking and other strenuous tasks.  It might depend on how tight you cinch the watch while wearing it, or perhaps on wrist shape - I could see that others could be bothered by it, but it has not bothered me at all.  Also, others have complained about the buttons being difficult to push - I have to agree the buttons are not the easiest to push compared to many other G's, BUT like I mention above I don' t mind it or notice it as much, and it seems to have improved as the buttons have become broken in.  The buttons on this Mudman will not be for everyone, I am not trying to say they are easy to push  - only that I don't mind them, and I realize to make the watch mud proof there has to be some trade off.Considering I got this watch for much less than the retail price here on Amazon, I could not be happier with its performance after five months of ownership.Would recommend to anyone looking for a tough, good looking G.", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "Do not follow the \"size up\" advice.My husband wears a 11.5 D.

However, I do have my problems with it, which I've detailed below.Comfort: 5/5 this wig is very comfortable, not itchy, and very light. The most comfortable wig I've worn yet.Color: 5/5 the color of this wig is a nice deep rose pink. It's exactly how I would imagine Luka's hair to look, and the fibers are blended a bit for realism. It looks like a realistic pink.Length: 4/5 It's a great length, but it tangles quite easily, as do all long wigs. As such, I have to fuss with it a lot in order to keep it from tangling into a rat's nest.Style: 3/5 I don't like the fact that it's curly. The curls were frizzing quite a bit when I took the wig out of the bag and brushing them made it worse. I straightened it on a low setting and it looked much better. I also had to style the bangs to a straight blunt bang style since that's what I needed, but I didn't take off points for that. I really liked that this wig is layered.Thickness: 2/5 This wig is really sparse. I didn't want to believe some of the other reviews. It looks all right in photos but I was completely self-conscious because I could feel where my wig netting was showing in the back. The wig fibers are unevenly distributed, so there are random spots where it's thinner than others. After a straightening and mild brushing, some of the wefts started to come out too. I'm not sure that I can use this wig again especially since I will have to rebrush it.(tl;dr) OVERALL: 3/5For $13, I don't regret spending the money. The color is spot-on, and the wig is quite comfortable. However, if you want a high quality wig that looks like the photo, prepare to be disappointed.

It's very nice for what it is used for and it's waterproof to 100M! I can snorkel in the sea with this and just wash it with some fresh water when I'm done, with no problem. I've found the display on this watch to be very clear,crisp and easy to read at a glace, the screen is large and has all the information laid out nicely. You can see the time,day of the week, year and date (month-day),and alarms on the display, no need to press any buttons to find them. Also what I really like is, in the stopwatch mode, at the bottom of the screen there is the current time displayed. Another great feature is the dual time mode, the watch displays your current time in the bottom of the screen as well,so you can have both times easily visible.

Titanium is said to be about 40% lighter and almost twice as strong as stainless steel. It's also highly resistant to corrosion in sea water and chlorine.The choice of theSeiko Men's SGG707 Titanium Case and Bracelet Watchwas based on looking at a number of different watches from a myriad of manufacturers here, and there were plenty to choose from. Titanium is a good material for watch cases and bands due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, and is highly corrosion resistant. Have also owned a few Seiko watches over many years without a single failure, so it became natural to look for one with this combination. I was looking for a good everyday watch, one without too many extra dials, yet minimally still offering a full-size second hand along with the date.&#9670; Likes:+ Sturdy and well-crafted; charcoal-grey dial, simple functional design+ Machined titanium case; much lighter than stainless steel+ Titanium link band; adjustable; very comfortable+ Fold-over clasp; offers easy basic adjustments+ Water-resistant; good to 165 feet (50 meters)+ Japanese analog quartz movement; quiet, keeps excellent time+ Hardlex crystal; high impact and scratch resistance+ Excellent value; very reasonably priced+ 3-year warranty; backed by Seiko (see product description)&#9670; Dislikes:- None so far, and none expected&#9670; First Inpressions:The watch arrived in the familiar blue Seiko box as seen in the product image. Inside was the watch, a Seiko display cushion, and assorted warranty and instruction material. The directions are in a variety of languages, and it took only a few seconds to set the time, day and date functions. The day of the week is visible in English or Spanish, and is easy to change as per the instructions.&#9670; In Use:Found that the watch was too large for my wrist, so I first removed the spring bar pin from the fold-over clasp. Laying the watch flat on a cloth, I then took away two of the links by removing two of the flat, L-shaped pieces of metal that slide into the center of a link and lock it into place. One needs to just look for the small arrows on the inside of the watch bracelet links, which indicate the direction the pins and links need to be slid off of the band. I then removed two links from the titanium band, using the tip of my smallest needle-nosed pliers, then replacing the necessary L-shaped pieces of metal. I then carefully reinserted the spring bar pin into the fold-over clasp, making sure that it was lined up properly.This adjustment was done in less than five minutes, but it's only fair to say that this needs to be done cautiously, and one should be careful to keep the spring bar pin from flying away, as they're prone to do. If you have any doubts, take the watch to a competent jeweler to have it done. Enough said on this.This watch with its band is made completely from titanium, which is a lustrous metal with a burnished silver color, one that is highly resistant to corrosion. A few years ago I had switched over to titanium frames with my eyeglasses, and they were light, durable, and had no allergic reaction with my skin. The metal in this watch has those same hypoallergenic characteristics. You'll find it difficult to find a lighter or stronger material than titanium, and this watch is beautifully crafted from that alloy.Have owned many watches over the years, both expensive and bargain priced, but in terms of overall reliability and hassle-free operation, those from Seiko and Timex have been the best. I still have aTimex Men's T45101 Expedition Easy Set Alarm Classic Analog Watchthat was bought here years ago, and still functions well as the watch that I use in adverse weather conditions.Other styles considered included this similarSeiko Men's SGG705 Titanium Case and Bracelet Watchwith its white face and theSeiko Men's SGG709 Titanium Case and Bracelet Watchwith a blue dial. There are quite a number of different faces here is you look.Must admit that I did look at many different titanium watches here, including the far more costlySeiko Astron GPS Solar Powered Watch. This is a newly introduced satellite radio-corrected timepiece that is is powered by all types of light, according to the manufacturer. This model is one of a series with a three dimensional dial and a ceramic bezel which offers superior abrasion resistance. It has a case and bracelet made from high-intensity titanium, and is said to be as strong as steel, but at only 60% of its weight. Gives one something to consider for the future.Summary:The purchase of thisSeiko Men's SGG707 Titanium Case and Bracelet Watchwas the result of months of infrequent browsing here on Amazon, and of occasionally asking friends 'in the business' their opinions on both Seiko and titanium watches in general. Had looked at a number of different offerings, from basic watches to elaborate chronographs with many features as I slowly narrowed the field. The final result was this titanium Selko with is charcoal grey face, a simple, lightweight & honest timepiece.6/4/2013", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "I love this backpack for its room, room, room!

Actually there wasn't a lot of options in a size 8 or 9 for these boots and I was a little bummed I didn't get to choose one of the cute colors.1st Pair: left boot fit like a dream! Snug but not too small comfy like a wet suit! Right boot was HUGE! Checked the size, right boot womens size 10. Amazon as always was quick to make up for the mistake.2nd Pair: Actual size 8's. Left boot fit awesome. Right boot just a hair too snug. After 5 minutes of wearing it in the house my foot was sore. DANG, returned.3rd Pair: Tried a pair of Mucks Edgewater size 8. They were a Mens/Womens boot so even though the length felt good the boot felt loose on calf/leg/foot.4th Pair: Bogs High Handle Classic in size 9.

I put my boot  on and stuck it under the shower for about 1 minute. The water just beaded up and rolled off. Inside remained dry. Walking through the wet melting snow to the car I have not had any wetness. I have not slipped on anything in these boots yet. I wore them outside all afternoon in 2 feet of wet melty snow the other day and my feet stayed warm and dry. I also spent about 5 to 10 minutes wading around in a puddle of mud and slush. It wasn't quite deep enough to reach the neoprene part but the lower part did its job. After words I just walked threw the snow and the boots were clean in seconds. Will update this in the future.Last I don't know if this is good or bad but if I wear these around the house my feet get sweaty. I'm not a sweaty person and never have sweaty feet.

They are just a lot more comfortable and better looking on your head in my opinion.  This hat is made of quality material, thick and warm, and I really like the looks of the ribbed design in it. I don't think too many people would be disappointed in the looks and quality of it...That being said, I have to say I was still somewhat disappointed in the lack of real slouch in it.  Even though it fits loose and comfy on my head it still doesn't slouch as much as it does in the picture.  The reason why all these hats look slouchy in the pictures is because no one is wearing them.  Once stretched over the head they stick up and barely slouch at all.  It does slouch a little, but just a smidgen in my opinion.  And I feel anyone that is looking at this for just that reason alone may be disappointed.In conclusion, this a very nice looking quality hat that is extremely comfortable when wearing it.

The style looks much more expensive than the price. The face is a beautiful deep red color. Very rich looking and provides a lot of contrast to the hour, minute and second hands. It helps make it easier to tell the time even in low light. The numbers and details on the face are very detailed. I don't feel that the size of the face is either too big or too small but rather just right. The date window is a bit on the small side but quite readable. It would help to have the day displayed as well. Not a dealbreaker though for me but is the reason I did not award a five-star rating. Yes, the black portions of the watch, ie. the band and perimeter of the watch itself are plastic, but a very high quality plastic! Seems durable and is holding up well to the unavoidable bumps and scrapes any watch encounters. Will the battery really last ten years? Maybe it will...maybe the watch won't even last that long but even if not it seems very well made and  ready to provide years of service Lastly, it's keeping excellent time too.

They didn't feel super flat or inflexible like other flip flops out there.2) Durable - I had my last pair for 7 years!

My first FitFlops were the bronze Walkstar III sandals, and they were/are the most fabulous, amazing thong sandals I've ever owned.  I absolutely love them.  Once they've formed to my feet (after less than a day of wear) they were/are a dream to wear.  But, then I wanted more colors, so I ordered the silver Walkstar III and a black Oasis FitFlops.  The Black Oasis sandals seem to even fit and wear better than the bronze Walkstar III, but the silver Walkstar III sandals hurt from the get-go and continue to hurt my feet, even after wearing many, many times over last sandal season and into this season--don't know why but somehow they are different, the toe-thong cuts where the others don't and the heel cushion doesn't seem to absorb the shock on heel to toe impact like the other two pairs do.  I now only wear the silver ones when I'm going to be out for a short period of time and never for long walks.  So, whether these shoes work for you could depend on which color you order, or perhaps FitFlops manufacturing process is not of a consistent quality assurance as it definitely should be for the price of the shoes and the proclamations they make.  Although from previous reviews they do have more satisfied customers than non, and perhaps that is the company's acceptable margin of error.  I would still most definitely recommend these shoes, just perhaps if you happen to get a sore pair, don't give up and try another, but that is difficult to expect since one has to wear them for awhile to know whether they will work or not, and current return policies don't allow the return of worn shoes.  Perhaps that is some kind of guarantee/warranty that FitFlops needs to consider if they aren't going to consistently make the same shoe during manufacturing.As far as fitness--if you've got a properly made pair--for the first time relative sedentary user, one may feel some (very mild) workout burn in their calves and inner knee area to the lower inner thigh  (I did), but that soon goes away after continual wear.  They do seem to help with posture related back problems somewhat.  But these are basically just shoes, so don't expect miracles if you have really bad posture to begin with or any considerable amount of fat to burn off in the legs, thighs, and hips, but whatever walking exercise you take on during the sandal seasons these will help absorb a great deal of shock in your workout and offer a better reach and control than you can get from any other sandal or flip flop.", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "For everyday launge or gim... yes. this is your procuct.I love the soft part inside the fleece, it feels good on skin.", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "This is a great t-shirt bra.
