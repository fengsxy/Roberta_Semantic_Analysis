If you could fasten these up around boots it would 100% prevent any chance of snow getting in your boots and they would be perfect.

I've decided that I'll wear their itchy gowns during labor and pushing on the first day, and then wear my Gownie on the second day after I've had a shower and cleaned up and everything. Hopefully I won't get any blood on it then since I'll have a pad and everything.

The snaps came down far enough for me to be able to breastfeed and the snaps were so easy to do that I didn't need any help putting it on. I ended up not wearing any hospital gown at all, because I was so far along in labor by the time I got to the hospital that they did not make me change out of the dress I was wearing, which was black. Lucky me! But anyway, I loved the Gownie. I washed it in the same detergent I washed my baby's clothes in so that when I was holding her against me she would not be in contact with yucky chemicals that might irritate her sensitive newborn skin. I still use the Gownie as a nightgown since it is great for breastfeeding or pumping at home. The fabric is so soft compared to other hospital gowns that I don't mind wearing it at all.When I was in the hospital I received many compliments on my pretty Gownie from nurses and the baby photographer.

There are more apps offering a variety of new capabilities with additional apps in development.  I look forward to exploring those and adapting them for my use.

I'm sort of right in between but I'm pushing a D pretty close. C-cups are too little but I can still get away with them and D-cups are just a tad big but I can do them as well. This medium fits perfectly. It doesn't cut in under my boobs like other sleep bras and it doesn't overlap on top of them. I definitely plan to order more but I want order 2 Larges as well as a few more Mediums. I grow a cup size to a cup plus half a size after baby is born, compared to what I am pre-pregnancy, so I think I'm going to need a large or two as well, as I'm anticipating being a large D or DD the first month if it's anything like my first.", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "This is a really nice cardigan.

(add another $1,000 for Platinum)While searching around I didn't exclude Amazon, after all we buy virtually everything else here, and found some remarkable deals.However rings from Metal Masters kept popping up in my searches. My first reactions were to roll my eyes - how could any ring priced this low look good, unless it was dark out and you were looking at it from 500 feet away.But the designs kept drawing me back.We had long discussions about using the money (4 grand and up) for a pair of rings or putting it into our 60 year old house which we're remodeling and repairing at a snails pace. I wrote a note to Metal Masters regarding sizing and quality of the CZ and they replied quickly with a detailed response.*Note to other potential buyers - remember when ordering a \"comfort fit\" that you want a half size down for a proper fit. So if you wear say a 9 order a 8.5 and so on.Well, expecting to be disappointed, after all how could a ring priced this low even appear to be of reasonable quality? I ordered two of this style and two of the eternity rings - another great reason to buy these is that you can afford to do just that. Without out having to put 2 grand per ring as a deposit. For lack of better words all I can tell you is that we were absolutely knocked out. Especially with the Eternity ring. The Titanium is gorgeous, seamless and perfectly cast.The matte finish with it's high polish border is really stunning and that would be without the stones. With the stones? They're incredible. Channel setting must be done by hand, shoddy work means uneven settings and loss of stones. Not the case here. The setting of each and every Brilliant cut CZ is perfectly spaced and perfectly set. The rings easily compared to ones we saw costing over $2,000 apiece.The Cubic Zirconia crystals are top quality and flawless. CZ isn't new - it was discovered in the mid 1800's but wasn't introduced as an alternative to diamonds until 1976. CZ still remains the number one competitor to actual diamonds today. CZ is colorless, can be cut just like diamonds, and are very hard, measuring an 8 on the Mohs scale which is harder than most gem stones - Diamonds measure a 10, only two points above CZ. Depending upon the cut both will refract (pull in light and bounce it around inside the stone) and reflect (beam the light out) which causes the \"sparkle\" so no or dim light = no sparkle regardless if it's a diamond or CZ.As far as the look of authenticity - only an experienced jeweler or gemologist would be able to tell the difference and that's with the help of Loupe or other magnification. This is Because even the finest diamonds in the world have inclusions inside that can't be seen with the naked eye. Quality CZ on the other hand has no inclusions whatsoever. Ironically it's their perfection that gives them away.With all this said, these rings are an incredible value and a wonderful alternative to diamonds.What is more, anyone who understands the horrors of diamond trafficking will have the peace of mind in knowing they played no part in supporting it.The rings arrive exceptionally well packaged, each in a Metal Masters presentation box, sized perfectly and delivered with lightening speed. Add to the mix a company tha's responsive and stands behind their product 100% and you just can't go wrong.As far as durability these rings get knocked around plenty and after months still not a single scratch or loose stone.Simply a sensational piece of jewelry with a timeless design that you'll be proud to own and even prouder to wear.**UPDATE 5/27 2014**There have been a few comments asking about how these rings have held up. The review was written over two years ago and I'm pleased to report they look as good now as they did when the first arrived. Titanium rates a #6 on the Mohs scale for metals making one of the hardest metals there are - Steel rates a 4.5 so I expected the the Titanium to wear well and has. We never take the rings off and they're still scratch free.As for rhe CZ it's as brilliant as it ever was. These are top quality CZ crystals and have proven themselves as they're inclusion free and every single crystal is still firmly in place. Just a quick update folks on durability whic I rate a solid 10.", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "I bought them as a present for my boyfriend and he couldn't be happier.

It's not enough to make me regret the purchase, though.

It is difficult to find a pretty bra in my size, so I really appreciate Lilyette's decision to make a feminine bra in large cup sizes.  The description reads \"unlined underwire\" yet there is a light lining under the lace.  I have worn seamless bras for years, so was really surprised at how perky I look in this bra.  There is a lot of lift without squeezing the girls to the middle.  Being full busted, I don't need a bra to create additional cleavage.  The seams do show just slightly through summer-weight clothing, but I'm confident they won't show at all during sweater weather.  The seams line up in a way that eliminates certain issues that can pop up in a sudden chill.  I have subtracted 1 star because the wider, lacy part of the bra straps ends in a seam right at the top of my shoulder which becomes uncomfortable after a few hours.  I wish all bra makers would keep in mind that large busted women need the comfortable portion of the straps to be longer than a smaller bra size might need.  It seems like it would be an easy design flaw to correct.

They are adjustable in three places: over the for-foot, over the ankle, and the back of the foot above the heel. Construction is rugged and tough.

The straps are cushioned underneath, where they touch the foot, so there is no chaffing or blisters, no rubbed skin at all, even on the very first wear. The best part is the sole and foot bed. Incredibly comfortable, it feels like a tiny bounce when I run, but still very supportive. I feel as if I retain much of the muscle movement possible when barefoot, but with a cushioned sole beneath me.These work particularly well for me since, due to a medical condition, one foot is taller near the for-foot/ball.

Further, the material is what you'd expect from a rashguard...a relatively thin nylon blend. It's not wetsuit material or anything. It's extremely stretchy. Bottom line: This is supposed to be tight, because it is a rashguard. In my opinion, if you want it to fit like a rashguard, you should order the shirt size that you normally wear...anything bigger will be, well, bigger!I gave it 4 stars only because the fit is a bit baggy at my natural waist, because the shirt is cut pretty straight (just a pet peeve of mine that companies tend to cut women's shirts the same way the cut men's, with no tailoring in at the waist).

The metal bracelet is a must-have feature for me, as I hate the rubber watch bands that most of the digital watches come with. In addition, the watch is very nice-looking, and works with casual, dress, or sport. If my old G-Shock is anything like this watch, it should last a long time.

I'm not one to be told \"I can't\" do anything, so I thought that these shoes, with the suede toe sole would allow me a little more movement than regular sticky-shoes.I am able to move around better--not great, but not too bad.  The slippery (not too slippery, though) sole allows me more \"slide\" than a regular shoe, even with the hard leather soles.The arch support is really nice--I have little to no structural support skeletally in my left foot now, and have to wear special shoes that transfer my weight off of the front of my feet--these do the trick relatively well, and are comfortable.  They equalize my weight across the bridge of my foot instead of placing so much pressure on the front/toes.Any limitations that I do have are from my physical injuries--not the shoes.  I love these shoes, and have been recommending them to my friends for dancing :)As far as the size...well, I'm a \"true\" 8.5.

The current 8926OB uses a Seiko Instruments NH35A movement, however the 8926OB's NH35A does not have any markings indicating country of origin for the NH35A. The SII manual for the NH35A shows either Japan or Malaysia, but it is not shown on the NH35A in the 8926OB! The watch face says Japan Movement, but the rotor on the NH35A should show this as well.The band feels very cheap, just like an average run of the mill Casio. The hinges are crimped/stamped steel and not like the higher-end Seiko, Citizen, or almost all of the typical Fossil watches. The safety clasp is extremely tight mainly to prevent accidentally releasing the band clasp while diving, but it is cumbersome to use. The band links are also made inconsistently. Some of them are a tight fit against another link, while other links are so loose that the pins fall right through. The links also bend forwards and backwards, not like the Fossil links which are sturdier.The unidirectional bezel is tight at first, but it has solid clicks and lines up properly. The watch face in my opinion is a bit small. I could confuse it for a lady's watch when used on a man's wrist. The watch itself is also plastered with Invicta logos and designs, which I feel are rather tacky. The magnifying lens / cyclops on the watch glass looks really out of place, as if they glued on a plastic lens to the watch glass. The worst part was that I actually found dust prints and residue underneath the watch glass.As for accuracy, don't expect any from this watch and movement. Even though it was within spec, I was losing 3-5 seconds per day when fully wound and inside an automatic watch winder. I understand that this is the nature of an automatic mechanical watch, but I just wanted to convey this again in case anyone was curious about it.I have another Invicta and was not impressed with its quality either. I won't be considering Invicta in the future.

Also, relatively cool to wear all day, and I didn't feel pinched or cut anywhere by the edges. Four stars.Why minus one? The one thing I just don't get is the way the crotch closes: hook and eye closures, with three rows for adjustable sizing as for a bra, right in the dead middle. THIS IS SO AWKWARD.

It's still very comfortable, and reasonably soft.And come to think of it... if you're actually using this to go skiing with (which I am not.) it might be better to have more polyester in the shirt to resist water absorption from snow.My last small complaint: the sleeves are about an inch and a half shorter than I need them to be to cover my wrists.

It's not a deal-breaker for me, if it bothers me, I'll just add a bias binding or something. I may do that anyway since the dress hits a few inches above my ankles (I'm 5'6&#34; and wide) and I prefer my hems to hit at my ankles (I like long)  If you're a slender person, it will most likely fit you longer  :)OVERALL:  I honestly enjoy these so much that I would buy them again  :D", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "I tried one size smaller, but for my narrow foot, the strap is still too loose.
