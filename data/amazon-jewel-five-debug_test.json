It looks like someone has traveled across Australia on foot wearing them and then used them for ocean swimming and wrestling crocodiles and decided to return them. I would love to get a pair of jeans like this in a new dark blue and get a chance to wear the denim out myself. If you do like your jeans worn in then these are for you. From the look of the selection of dungarees from Lee they are all pre worn or stressed. These are a well made and well fitting jean.

They fit very well, and the room in the toe isn't too much.  Orthaheels seem to favor those of us with a wider foot, and for me they are perfect.  There is comfort in the toe box without all the floppiness in the heel.  The support is wonderful.  I also have nerve damage on top of my foot so the banding on top was a bit of a concern since I can't stand having any pressure against those nerves.  For whatever reason the bands don't bother me at all.  They are like wide elastic hairbands, supporting the sides of your foot without undo confinement.

There are also a few slots in the center lay out for frequently used cards or gift cards, etc.  i don't think you'd have to worry about any cards falling out of the slots in this area.There are magnets that hold the two sides together and they are pretty strong--again top quality.

They are a believeable size and can pass for the real thing.  If I had gotten a 5mm stud, as I had originally planned, I would have been very unhappy with the smaller size.  The backings are snug and secure. I may buy a disk backing just to make the stud stand up a little more.  But, if I don't, the earrings will still look good.

As I got older the miles started to cause more pain on my knees and shins and I couldn't just run through it like I used to. My doctor recommended I try these. I was a bit weary at first but after some exhaustive research I decided to take the plunge and I am glad I did. My knee and shin pains is gone. I have friends who have experienced the same relief of pain they had dealt with all their lives, knee, shin, and back pain.Now this isn't some magic shoe, but what the shoe does is helps us, as humans, run they way we are supposed to. The way we had run for tens of thousands of years. Keep in mind that footware of all kinds are relatively recent. Long before trainers came about we were running, barefoot or in flimsy sandals and doing just fine. What these shoes do, and similar minimalist shoes like them from New Balance, Merrell and Reebox, is help the body run in a more natural manner. The heal strike that is so common today has come about as we added thicker and thicker cushioning to our shoes. When barefoot it is not natural to strike the ground with your entire weight on the heel of your foot. A good example of natural running is to go watch kids run barefoot, before they are taught the 'correct' way to run they run the natural way. Which is to land more gently on the forward part of your foot and role the foot front to back, instead of hammering your heel into the ground.With that in mind wearing these shoes takes some time to retrain the foot so start building up slowly. I found that just having my toes separated felt very odd but after a few days of wearing them around the house I had gotten used to it. Now I am running some of the fastest laps of my life with this 'new' type of shoes and a 'new' type of running. There is a lot of good information available online about barefoot running, which you are essentially doing with these types of shoes. Youtube also has a wealth of information. These shoes have turned what used to be a painful experience back into the joy of running I had been missing. I've already recommended them to a number of my fellow runners with wonderful results.I want to include a few words of caution though. The Five Finger shoes aren't for everyone, some people will have toes that are longer and will not be able to fit comfortably in the toe pockets. Not to worry though, Merrill and several other makers now offer similar shoes without the toe pockets for people who need them, or just find the toe pockets too strange. Also you don't have a large robust sole to offer protection so kicking a rock or the like during a run is a painful experience. I've also found that during longer runs socks like the Innijin socks help prevent heat build up and blisters.", "label": "very positive"}, {"text": "It's a bit small in the arms.

Enough that when the hooks failed after a few hours of initial wear I immediately arranged to exchange it. I'm not scared that this was a crap product.So let's just stick this out front and in the open: I'm a short person with huge bosoms. I play a high impact sport and am very active at least 6 hours every week in addition to several more hours of mild to moderate activity. Up until this little wonder came into my life I've been relying on a a brand that rhymes with Thunder Farmer to tame the girls. At best I would call that experience &#34;meh,&#34; especially compared to this bra. In retrospect I was clearly wearing the wrong size- actually, I would say I've been wearing the wrong size since the first time I tucked the projecting womanhood into a bra.I digress: if you are relying on what the old lady with the paper tape measure at the big box chain store told you is your size you are probably wearing the wrong size. If you walk into a fitting and they tell you to add four inches, just walk away. This is a big fat lie. Why would you do that? If your band (or underboob, whatever you want to call it) is 30 why would you suddenly and arbitrarily say it's a 34? Once you get that through your head it's a really simple thing to figure out your cup size. Bend over, let the hanging baskets descend in all their glory, measure loosely, and you're done. For UK sizing, my underboob measured 29 (went with 30), the baskets hit 10 inches, so that says I'm a 30GG. Simple. Moving on.In the Thunder Farmer I was wearing a 34DD because that's as big as they get. It never felt like it was as supportive as a high impact sports bra should be but it seemed like it was the best out there. Man, was I wrong. I was skeptical that I was wearing the wrong size, and even more skeptical that this bra would be the magical rainbow unicorn of sports bras. Amazon has been fabulous to work with and the return policy for Prime is more than fair, so I figured I had nothing to lose. A gamble, add to cart, two days later the box arrives, and I tried it on.Just trying it on was a whole other adventure that I won't spoil for other newcomers that are coming to the light from the dark side of vicki's (dirty little) secret. &#34;Is it seriously supposed to be this tight?&#34; &#34;And now I'm supposed to bend over and wiggle everything into the cups HOW?&#34; &#34;But this is a sports bra, why are there two distinct bumps instead of tubeboob?&#34; And my favorite &#34;holy crap, I can see my feet when I look down. Is that what's supposed to happen when the gore actually rests against your skin?&#34; (Note: look up what bra parts are if you don't know what the gore is).Again, I was skeptical, but luckily I had a three hour high intensity event the following morning and felt like it was the perfect time to take it for a test drive. First up: jumping. Let's just say that busty girls do not like jumping. Not even a little. Even if you manage to tame the girls into minor submission you can still feel your breast tissue shifting across the top of your chest, across your pectoralis muscles. After a while you start to feel it in your neck and shoulders, and eventually it creeps all the way into your lower back and ribs. So jump I did, keenly aware that this was a great test of the &#34;86% reduction in bounce&#34; claim. Especially since the breasts were actually separated and not mushed together into the equivalent of wrapping an elastic bandage around your chest. I'm not exaggerating when I saw I felt NOTHING. Not even a little jiggle. Jumped again. and Again. Over and over, and not once did I feel that familiar tug across my chest.Then it was a bunch of lateral agility stuff, then hitting (for the record, I play roller derby). And being hit. After three hours I noticed that I had zero pain associated with bounce and fatigue from trying to compensate for the bounce. I had a serious neck injury almost one year ago so I've been keenly aware of just how much pain the bounce can create in a matter of minutes. Did I say I had zero pain? Because that's a really important detail.Once the event was over I had another event to plan for that night, a full game with a four hour drive. When I got home I took this off. Warning- it takes a couple times wearing it to get used to the difference in how tight the band is in comparison to the poorly fitting band you may have been wearing until then. My skin was a little red where the wires sat, and there were a couple other marks on my back and small ones on the back of my shoulders from where you can clip it together for a racerback style. No biggie. After a quick lunch and clean-up I noticed that two of the three hooks had pulled away from the band rather significantly, and not in a way that I could fix, so I knew I would need to exchange it. Shrugged it off, I had to go, so I put it back on and left it alone for almost seven more hours.Since setting up to exchange with the first one until now I have had no problems with the replacement. I wear this for every single practice, event, work-out, and even the days I'm just going to be moving around a little more than usual. It is honestly the perfect sports bra. I love that it can be easily converted to a racerback style that provides a little bonus lift, and I can disconnect it with one hand. The straps are just the right width. They do not cut or dig into my skin but are not too wide to stick out or sit uncomfortably on my shoulder blades. I do not notice any cutting into my under arms, but it does sit a little higher than I'm used to. The fabric is lined to create support and modesty, but not heavily padded to create shapes that do not occur in nature. The underwires are slightly wider than what I find in everyday-type bras, and this creates a lot more stability in the support I experience.In summary: make sure you're wearing the CORRECT size bra, not what that little old lady told you it was, then give this sports bra a shot if you want great support, great shaping, and comfort. It will take some getting used to but it's worth it. If it didn't look so much like a censor bar I would wear this every. single. day. And if you have a Prime account you have no excuse to not try this. If you've read this far then take my advice and just buy it.", "label": "very positive"}, {"text": "This is a great scarf or shemagh. I bought this a few weeks ago and really enjoy it.

Things really stay put and cannot roll off the table- Useful inside zipper pocket for small jewelry or a watch, etc.- Supposedly washable- I got it in the silver, and it looks quite good, the quilting is especially nice lookingCONs: *updated 8/15/2013 reg. washing instructions - point 2 below*- While it looks big when laying flat, it does not provide all that much storage room when cinched shut- Contrary to my initial assessment that there were no washing instructions, another reviewer (see Comments) pointed out to me that those instructions can indeed be found sewn into the outer Velcro pocket. According to these, the bag can be hand-washed. Sorry for not finding these on my own :-)- The drawstring closes the kit up but not 100 %. If something were to spill inside the pouch, it is easy to see how this could create a mess inside one's purse/handbag. I'm thinking rouge breaking apart, anything powder-y for that matter...- Pricey. In all honesty, the kit reminds me of the hood on a sports or even light down jacket - both in feel and material. It opens up wider than most hoods do but essentially there is not much more to it than that. I think what one is paying for here is more so the idea (and it is a nifty one, for sure!) than the product value itself.SUMMARY:It works, but at a price of over $30 this is way too expensive. I love the idea, and it seems to be OK quality-wise but I would not buy this again at this price. If money is not an issue, you will likely be happy with this pouch but I for one keep looking at this kit and cannot decide whether I like it or whether someone pulled a fast one on me :-) 3.5 stars if that were possible.", "label": "neutral"}, {"text": "Box chains are the strongest.

With a V neck more shows and it is very pretty.", "label": "very positive"}, {"text": "I have had this watch for 3.5 years now, with no major complaints, finding it to be a great everyday use watch.This may sound preposterous, but I purchased this as a replacement for a Rolex Submariner that I received as a gift 20 years ago.  The Rolex was a great watch, although a bit big and heavy.  Servicing it was more than the cost of this watch, and the latest repair would probably be ten times the cost, so into the safety deposit box the Rolex went.  I do miss the ability of the Rolex to be completely submerged, having used it as a dive watch for years before giving up the sport, but the Citizen is much better for everyday use.It is hard to find tasteful, well made, and reasonably priced watches, which I believe the Citizen mostly satisfies.  With the exception of the strap, that is.  I did not care for the big metal grommets for the holes, but it was otherwise OK.  The watch is not too gaudy, with plenty of function, including an easy to read dial, second hand, and day/date.  As noted, I did not care for the strap and suspected that the leather/nylon material would get a bit funky with use, as others have noted. After a year or so, I replaced it with a plain nylon olive drab band that is a little easier to keep clean and odor free.As for accuracy, the watch requires only a 1-2 minute adjustment every few months, if that.  Anyone that has come from a self-winding watch (even high end models from my limited exposure), should know the need for regular adjustments.  My Rolex was off by several minutes every month, so I was happy to not have to adjust a watch as often.  My job requires a high level of precision, so having a good, accurate timepiece is a necessity, and this watch does that.  This is all based upon the online Navy atomic clock as my reference time, not one of those radio synchronised clocks, which I find to vary widely.As noted, the dial is easy to read, with the day/date function very useful for those of us confused about the day of the week (I'm a bit absent minded about the year at times!).  The black face makes it easy to read the dial.  Nighttime viewing is not as great as a doped display, but acceptable for the cost (not electroluminescent, alas).  The crown is protected by arms on either side, which is a welcome touch for those of us not so coordinated, and I have not had any issues with the crown or arms.The crystal sits proud of the surface, as crystals usually do, but I rather wish it had some sort of raised protection outside it, as the crystal has become very well scratched with use.  The scratches have only been more noticeable in the last year, so it is not all bad, and the watch is still readable. If I get another two years out of the watch, it will be a good value in my opinion, and if the watch is still for sale, I will probably order another one from Amazon (rather tempted to order one now and set it aside).  Coming from the scratchless sapphire crystal of a Rolex, I assumed this would happen, so I cannot say I am surprised.  A sapphire crystal would probably make the watch too expensive (although I wish it were an option, if Citizen is reading this), and as I well know, sapphire crystals are easily shattered from three foot drops onto hard tile floors...  So the crystal used is a fair trade I suppose.One of the selling points to the watch is the Eco-Drive function, which as is illustrated with the watch listing, charges the built-in battery using available light from the dial's nearly perfectly hidden, baked-in solar cell.  This was what finally sold me on this match, as I dislike quartz watches and their annoying battery replacements (I own several Seiko quartz watches).  The battery in the Eco-Drive is supposed to last 20 years if I recall correctly, so I expect it will outlast the crystal (see above).Given the strap issue and scratching I'm taking away one star, but still like, and use the watch daily.It is a great watch with caveats, and recommended.", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "Overall large and lengthy.

Light material, quite comfortable and doesn't get hot. My only complaint is the waist is too high. I'm 6'1&#34;, bought Medium and the waist has to roll down. Found it oddly uncomfortable at fist but have gotten used to it. Still - bring the waist band down 2&#34; and they would get 5 stars.  A+ for great feeling material, good compression for such a light weight material, cool enough to wear around the house when it's not winter. D+ for the high waist.

Amazon shipped directly to her(I'm excited..couldn't wait for her to get them), but I should've put them in a fancy box, and wrapped up for Christmas.  I could have heard her, \"Oh Trinny, you shouldn't have\". I'd had to tell her, \"Oh Pat, but I didn't\".  Seriously, these earrings have eliminated my desire for  beautiful natural diamonds of this carat weight. I'd have needed to save to purchase them, and still would have had a hard time justifying spending several thousand for a pair of earrings. My money is more wisely saved for more important purchases. I love these earrings!

And the molded cups are nice and supportive (and without the evil underwires!), but still soft.  I have had molded-cups bras that did the job, but were so stiff I was afraid if I picked up something and it mashed the cups I would go around with a punched-in boob till I could get somewhere private to poke the cup back out.  Probably be amusing to onlookers, but embarrassing to me :D  This bra isn't like that.  And the cups are actually DDD cups, so you don't get muffin-boob.The band is comfortable.  It didn't ride up in the back, which, when you are DDD is always a problem waiting to happen.  I cannot remember tugging at it even once.When I went up to change my clothes to go out, I completely forgot to change into another bra.  And it did not bother me all night long.  I am amazed.

These wouldn't be my first choice if cuteness was a necessity, but these slippers are great for my current need. The sole is a thick, solid rubber so walking on gravel has become a painless and nearly hazard-free event (I've tripped a time or two, but that's on me, not the slipper). These are also very warm and comfortable. They are lined with a thick ...faux fur? material; not Sherpa and not really fleece, so this is the best I can describe it. I am concerned that after a few months of wear the fur might become matted and smelly, but right now, I've had these for maybe two weeks and so far they are still looking, feeling and smelling just fine. I haven't yet had to wear these in the rain or snow, so I can't really comment on how they are wet, but they are real leather on the outside and rubber on the sole, so I would think they would have some resistance to light exposure to the elements. Of course, I imagine most people intend to wear these slippers indoors only so that shouldn't be a problem anyway.These definitely fit as expected; I'm usually a size 6.5 and bought a size 7 so they are a little big, but not awkwardly so.

I usually wear a 7.5 or 8 and bought the 8 to make sure I had plenty of toe room and, as another reviewer thought, with the strap in front I would be able to adjust it.  After a month or two of using the shoes 3xwk or so I began to realize there was little cushioning in the front ball of the foot area so decided to try a gel innersole.  No luck...still not enough cushioning and the shoe never softened up from its initial stiffness.  Then the shoes were stretching and becoming uncomfortably large and too loose for some of the lateral steps.  I usually wear well cushioned socks such a thorlo which did not help. So I added an extra innersole thinking it would take up the extra space.  No luck...in fact, I found myself tripping and falling during a number of lateral moves. I removed the extra innersoles but then after each Jazzercise session one or both of my feet would cramp horribly; enough so that it was painful and near impossible to drive home until they subsided!  Not good. Anyway I would not purchase these again for any price (even the now sale price of less than 1/2 what I paid!).I am not young, but fit and healthy.  I have exercised for all of my adult life either step aerobics, pilates, circuit training, running 3 miles, walking 4-5 miles daily, hiking/backpacking, skiing/ice skating, snowshoeing...and I continue to exercise 3-4 times a week.

Since then, it's already begun to grow on both of us. It actually looks very good on my husband, who is tall and lean but large-boned. This is definitely a masculine watch, and I think that it looks both sporty and classy at the same time. Neither my husband or I are big on gold jewelry, but the dual tone of this watch is versatile and just right. The gold has a very nice tone, it's not a really yellow gold, but a more subtle hue. (Perhaps that is due to the type of shine and finish?)It's hefty and solid, and seems to be very well made and high quality. I'm impressed with the silicone straps, they are very soft and comfortable but seem to be very durable. I do wonder at how well they will hold up, however, I'm guessing that if they ever need to be replaced, silicone is certainly going to be less expensive than metal.This watch makes a statement, it is not for the man who doesn't like to stand out. I also just don't think it'd look as good on a skinny arm, just something to think about. Also, the description of this product states that the buckle is gold toned--but it is actually silver, as the pictures show.

Other brands were either to short in the sleeves, neck to stretched out, fabric to thin, faded to quickly during washing, or the vertical length was to short, which was a pain if you tuck your shirt in and then when you bend down your shirt comes out. This shirt has a snug neck, not tight, which I like. The sleeve length falls just above the elbow about 1 inch, and the vertical length extends mid crotch level, so if you tuck your shirt in, it should not come out. I was also surprised on the thickness. It is thicker than most 100% poly sport t-shirts. It also looks good for casual wear as well. This is only based on the black t-shirt.

I looked at other watches for more money and the money was not even a consideration, because this watch covers those perfectly.I use it for speed work and road races. Its 50 lap is going to cover a person in any race (if you're doing an ultra marathon, they're not going to have mile markers that often anyway!). There are a couple of display formats, but I use the default, which has a cumulative time in the large numbers and, when one hits the lap button at a lap/mile, it freezes everything on the display, showing the cumulative at that last click as well as the last mile's time. It holds this for 10 seconds and then resumes, with the cumulative time on the bottom and the current lap on the top. One could probably switch those around, but I've not tried.Its 50 lap memory works well.Its 3 alarms are cool and it also has an interval timer, which I must admit I've not used.Timex OBVIOUSLY put a lot of thought into the design and functionality of this watch.

I like to put these gold beads on either end of the Pandora beads making up the necklace for the same reason: so there is gold to match the other gold pieces I have on.The thing I like the very best about these is that they retain their bright golden shine throughout all the wearings I give them. I have never had to clean one so that it retained its shine. Others that I have used, have been of poorer quality and have lost their lustre over time. These do not.I am also pleased with their size as they are fairly small and make nice \"ending\" pieces for my necklaces and great spacers for my bracelets. I have been using them for almost a year. Whenever I need gold for a bracelet or necklace, this is the bead I return to time after time.They have been invaluable for my uses and I certainly recommend them to you.NOTE: I have been using these beads for two years now and the gold is finally starting to wear off.

So... 17 years ago. These shoes lasted forever. I actually eventually LOST them during our last move. It's ok, I got my moneys worth! Plus I was tired of the color, the pair I had were a dark brown.I just got these in the redwood color with the soft footbed. I went for the soft footbed specifically because I recall, even after so many years, the rough break in period. These are comfy out of the box with the soft foot bed! Like a slipper. However I believe, I have no proof but I believe, that the soft foot bed will negatively impact the longevity of the shoe. I know the rubber on the bottom is replaceable and to some degree the cork is too from what I understand(I never had to replace the cork on my old pair though, if you replace the rubber before you hit the cork AND keep the cork sealed, you shouldn't need to) but I have no idea how the soft foot bed will affect repair or replaceability. My general guess is that it will wear out and need repair sooner. The redwood is a lovely color. I like it a lot because it's colorful enough to be interesting, but not so bright that it will clash or stick out.Sizing. I'll be honest, they are full of *you know what* on sizing. Back in 1995, prior to having two kids, the smallest size I could find in the store (this was pretty much pre-internet, I could buy it at the store or not buy it at all, ordering was difficult as the shoes were made in germany) was a 36. Back then, I was told a 36 was about equivalent to a 6-6.5. I was a 5. I purchased them anyway and they were very big on me. I didn't care, I just wore big fat socks with them. Ok, well time went on, I had two kids and my feet got larger.  I am now actually a size 6-6.5. Well when I went to order these I looked at the Birk size chart on the Birk website and it says that a 36 is equivalent to a 5-5.5 and a 37 was a 6-6.5. So based on that, I should have ordered a 37. And in fact every other pair of shoes I now own is a 6-6.5 or a 37 in euro sizing. I thought to myself that maybe over the years they had changed a little, maybe they ran smaller or something. Then I remembered they were a German company, not a US company, so I went ahead and ordered a 36. Bingo, they fit perfect. They are DEFINATELY a 6, someone who is a size 5 would be swimming in these shoes. I have wide feet so I did not get the narrow.Another really important note is that certain colors come with the soft footbed and other colors come with the classic footbed. They don't come in both options. So if you order redwood, it will have the soft footbed (at least as of right now in May 2012). The best way to know if it's classic or soft since you can't necessarily tell from amazon, is to hop on the Birkenstock website and see which color comes with which footbed.", "label": "very positive"}, {"text": "I wish they had a darker black, but the charcoal is okay.

There is a slight difference in design but the black/black is not a cheaper version. The black/black has slightly thicker inner padding and different stitching but seems like it will hold up better. Almost everyone complains about the tight fit ... well this is NOT a t-shirt .. it's a compression style moisture-wicking fit much like how under armour would fit. It is designed to be tight! I do not know how anyone who buys the correct size could have their weapon fall out. I am 5'9\" and 200lbs, 34\" waist and I bought a large size, yes it is tight but it's supposed to be. It is not uncomfortable and certainly does not compress my rib cage so much that I cannot breathe. I have pretty broad shoulders, chest and lats and I'm happy with the fit. Again, this is not a Haynes t-shirt. The one improvement I am going to make is the depth of the pocket. I am going to take it to my tailor and have her throw a seam to reduce the depth. It is large enough to hold a 4.5\" full size auto but that size pistol is too heavy. My 3.3\" XDs fits nicely as does my Glock 23, Kahr PM40 and P380 but again the pocket is too deep. Note that this shirt is going to be HOT! Moisture wicking means the fabric does not breathe ... i.e you're going to sweat your butt off. I live in FL and use to wearing performance undershirts in my daily duties so it doesn't bother me but brothers if you're hot blooded by nature then this is not a shirt you want to wear on a hot summer day. All-in-all I love these shirts ... I bought the black/gray because of the review claiming how much better it is but that is NOT the case. The black/black is the 2.0 improved version .. but both are nice. I hope this no nonsense review has helped. Stay safe.EDIT: Ok, after putting a little more thought into this ... as mentioned the gray/black padding is not at thick as the neoprene on the black/black and even with a proper fit I can see where it is possible to find yourself in a situation where the weapon can fall out. The gray/black is thinner therefore weapon retention is not as stable as the black/black. The black/black is better for chasing suspects or doing gymnastics :)  The gray/black may be a little more comfortable on the warm days.", "label": "very positive"}, {"text": "I bought these for my son for Christmas.

Found decent reviews for these in particular so made the purchase.  The bra itself is pretty awesome being very supportive and somewhat attractive.  The cup size, at least for me, was perfect.  The band size was a little snug though I believe that to be because it isn't \"broken in\" just yet.  I think a couple cycles through the washing machine will help.  The only real issue is after about 9 hours or so, the bottom of the band started to roll up so that I had to almost remove it and put it back on.  The tag also kind of bothers me which is a first with any bra.  Needless to say, the bra isn't perfect but does do a good job and is somewhat comfortable.Update 03/19/13: I bought the \"lacy\" version of the bra which does look pretty nice and is very supportive.  The problem is either the lace or the material difference between the \"lacy\" and \"non-lacy\".  The \"lacy\" version is VERY uncomfortable.  I constantly feel like I am being poked or scratched.  I do love the way it looks but the lack of comfort makes me want to throw it away.  This is almost worse than the under wire coming loose and poking.  I've washed these a couple times so far so maybe a few more washes would help?  I'm not really small though not super large either so I can't see this being an issue with weight.One more update 03/25/13: The secret to making these more comfortable is to throw them in the dryer.  I never used to dry bras in the dryer under the impression they wouldn't last very long.  Decided to try the dryer because I really wanted to like this bra and ran out of other ideas.  The dryer seems to have made them more \"lived in\" (kind of like jeans after washing/wearing awhile) and is definitely more comfortable.  They are snug and the cup size does seem pretty accurate so I will continue to wash and dry in the dryer instead of line dry.

Even my dad who is very into jewelry and gemstones sort of gasped and said, \"Where did you get THAT!\" when I wore it around him once. I laughed and told him it was just a cz ring I picked up, but I could tell he thought it was real even though he knows we could never afford real diamonds this large. I've often seen strangers staring at this ring from some distance away, too. I think the reason is because the setting is very well made as if for much more expensive stones and when I wear it I wear only this one on my right hand and my wedding set which is a vintage .50 carat diamond on my left hand.  Simplicity is the key. I do agree that the band could be a tad bigger and it would be more balanced maybe, but other than that it's pretty much perfect and has become one of my favorite rings.For those who said it looks cheap, well...

Keen's tend to run wider up at the front for the toes, which I love for hiking as it's far more realistic than fashionable. What I found is, the boot is so solid that it took me a few attempts to pull the laces as tight (up the shoe) as required, so it did seem too large the first time out.

For a few days, this bag will work fine, but even as a light packer I don't think this bag will be good for a week long trip. It's bigger than some other weekender type bags, but the size of the bag isn't really the issue as much as I question the durability of it.The shoe pocket is useful but doesn't hold bulky shoes too well, especially multiple pairs. I was able to fit two pairs of lower profile sneakers easily but couldn't have packed any boots or chunky basketball sneakers in there with anything else. The inside lining of the bag is bright and attractive, which is nice, although there are no pockets besides the shoe compartment to aid in organization. The color combination of the bag is also sharp with the tan handles. The plastic hardware seems to be a weak point, which is why I don't recommend this for people who pack heavy, even though the bag can hold it, the shoulder strap didn't feel very sturdy to me. The fabric they used to make the bag is feels nice to the touch but isn't as thick as expected. The stitching on the bag doesn't seem to be especially strong either. The zippers also didn't glide smoothly, but I fixed that by rubbing a pencil on the zipper. I've had to do that for some of my older bags, but having sticky zippers straight out of the package is not very confidence inspiring.Bottom line this is a bag that looks really stylish and is roomy, but has some questionable build quality. My friends swear by their Herschel bags, so maybe quality control has taken a dip as these have gotten more popular. For the price, I'm a little disappointed that I didn't get a higher quality feeling product. I feel like I paid for space I can't utilize fully since I'm scared this thing will bust at the seams and zippers if packed tight.

I have a pair that i've been using on the treadmill and the road for the past several months. But these Asics trail shoes are a different story. Too spongy, no feel, the stability is shaky over rocks and roots, the heel to toe drop is too pronounced for a comfortable trail run at any distance over a couple miles, it's like running on a pedestal. After a few miles on even a moderate trail with rocks, roots, and changes in elevation it really takes its toll on your feet, knees, and hip flexors. When you attempt to run properly, with changes to your stride on hills and dealing with smaller obstacles in your way the shoes end up hurting your toes. Going down even slight grades turned into an a very painful exercise that a trail runner cannot afford, safety wise. The weight of the shoe is also a problem, as in the sho is much too heavy considering the minimal protection afforded the wearer. And although I'm not one that has to love the way their shoes look, I'm still human and enjoy shoes that aesthetically pleasing. It seems that Asics was trying to get into a more modern scheme with the colors, incorporating the bright yellow/green citron shade that many shoe makers are using right now. Asics' attempt, unfortunately, is a disaster. The shoes don't look good. More importantly, the shoes, just don't look right. The citron yellow/green is two different shades in different places, and the shades are just similar enough to tell that they aren't meant to contrast or compliment, but they just clash and really makes the shoe look sort of silly. Looks like a bad shoe from the mid 80's.  In short, I've worn these 3 times now over the past 6 days and logged only about 14 miles in them. 7 of those are on a mix of light trails and pavement. I couldn't use them any longer b/c they were that bad. I have normal sized feet, unlike so many reviewers on here who apparently have size triple F width feet. If I needed a toe box the size of a small lifeboat, then perhaps i would think that \"hey, maybe it's just me.\" But I don't. And I know how to properly run trails. And even with a normal width foot, these shoes crushed my toes during a short trail run. Never again. I'm done with these. Asics really failed with this shoe. It's as if the designers NEVER ran on a trail. And then just suddenly decided one day to design a trail shoe that ultimately doesn't do very well running on trails. That's this shoe. Sorry Asics.

My job, while a very physical one, isn't outdoors, but since I live in Oregon, and walk/bike 3 miles to and from work most days, a good rain jacket is a necessity. This one certainly gets the job done, and I've been wearing it on an almost daily basis, and have thrown my thin rain coat into the closet, never wearing it since getting this beauty. The short story is that there's literally nothing wrong with this jacket. Not in terms of design, comfort, durability, none of that. But you definitely need to try one on before ordering, or at least make sure you check all the sizing info right down to the exact measurement. Since this was a gift, and the tags were taken off, I wasn't able to exchange it for a smaller size. I got a Medium and it can literally wrap around me like a robe. Just for reference, I'm 5'10\" and 155lbs...pretty average when it comes to it, but these suckers definitely run big, as others have said. Even though I match the size on chest and arms according to the size chart, I'm a small in the waist portion, and that might be what these go by.The amount of storage you get with this jacket is great. You have three standard pockets on the front: two near the waist and one on the left breast. These are very roomy and can close with zippers. I've fit an entire bicycle cable in one of these, with enough room for my keys and iPod in its case. On the inside, you have one pocket on each side, with one of them featuring an additional smaller pocket for small things like a lighter, change, anything like that. The inside of the jacket is lined with a mesh-like material, but the pockets are all reinforced, so there's no worrying about one of them suddenly getting a hole or anything like that. The jacket closes with both buttons and a zipper, ensuring that wind and rain won't even come close to your clothes underneath. What really got me was that they put an extra little flap that goes over the collarbone area. It might not seem like it'd help much, but it definitely makes a difference on windy nights. Carhartt even went the extra mile in giving the neck closure several strips of velcro, all perfectly put on and very sturdy. And the hood is fastened on with buttons, so you can remove it if you wish. But you know what the best feature is? The openings at the bottom of the sleeves feature additional cuffs, like the athletic under armor shirts. Not too loose or too tight, these cuffs will keep wind out 100% of the time, and as much as I like the jacket, if it weren't for these, I'd probably give it 4 stars instead. Whoever thought to put these on is a genius. How many times has wind went up your sleeves in other coats or jackets while you're just walking around, messing up with your comfort? That won't happen here.And do I even have to mention the waterproof factor? You can wipe the raindrops right off, and no matter how hard it's poured when I go home, this jacket has never stayed damp overnight like others I own. When I get home, it goes on the coat rack, and when I leave for work the next morning, it's as if it was never in the rain.Since I got a bigger size than I'd like, this may not apply to one that would've fit, but the hood on this thing is pretty big. So big that it doesn't move when I turn my head to look left or right- it just stays in place, not flexing with movement. If you get a chance to try this on before buying, make sure you put the hood on to see if the same thing happens. I know at the beginning of this review I said that I love everything about this jacket and there's nothing wrong with it, and I stand by that. Maybe it just doesn't move around because of the size issue. I don't know. If you wear a hat though, everything's fine.This is one of those rare cases where the price of the clothing is justified. Not only is the jacket comfortable (if a bit big), but it really does protect you from the rain and wind. This is the kind of thing you'll be keeping for a long time if you get it.

(I wear size 10) But when I put them on my feet they looked awesome! I walked around my kitchen and bathroom floor to check the traction on the bottom of the shoe. No slipping issues. They are wonderfully high and flattering to my calves. The platform front helps with stability. I'm going to order the tan and red pairs next!

This watch really looks much better in person than in pictures. It's not a overtly \"manly man\" watch like the legions of Submariner clones and military watches out there, but instead it's simple, elegant, and understated. I was a little concerned that the mirror-polished bezel would look too blingy or jewelry-like, but it actually balances nicely with the deep blue face and brushed-steel band. The watch itself is a good size if you are, like me, small-to-average in build. The exposed mechanics on the back side are an added bonus, especially for those of us who are relatively new to the world of automatics.The bracelet is also good quality for the money. It's put together well enough that I was easily able to remove a few links to resize the bracelet on my own. The last watch I got, an Orient diver model, was so stubborn that even the professional watch repairman had trouble with it. It's convenient to save yourself a trip to the watch shop and reassuring to know that you can modify the watch band however you like, whenever you like.As far as actual time-keeping goes, I'm sure it's losing or gaining a few seconds each day, but nothing noticeable, and I haven't had to reset the time yet. I haven't had any issues with it in the short time I've owned it.If you're looking for a big, complicated, eye-catching watch, keep looking. But if you want a simple, mid-sized dress watch with timeless good looks, or are just looking for an entry point into the world of automatic watches, this might just be the one for you. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better value for the money than the Seiko 5 line, especially with Amazon's regular discounts.Update: I've now had the Seiko for almost a month and I'm pleased with the accuracy of the movement. It's only lost about a second per week, which is incredible for any automatic watch, let alone one in this price range.

Pink is really better described as beige. Blue Lavendar is grey.  These colors go well with my wardrobe, but in case you really want pink and blue I wanted to make a note of the Barelythere color scheme.  Black and white colors, however, are exactly as one would expect.7/18/12I just ordered a couple of new bras and when I received them I saw that the branding was different.  Instead of Barelythere label, it had \"Bali comfort revolution\" label.  Before ordering I noticed the title said \"(Replaced with Bali 103J)\".  I wrote to the seller to ask her if this was the same bra or not, so I can be sure of the fit.  She wrote back that it was the same bra.

I read a LOT. Orient came up time and time again (too many puns there I know). The Orient Mako was considered a phenomenally built and crafted watch by even the watch 'snob' crowd who buy watches costing many thousands of dollars (and more).  I am stunned by how beatiful this watch is - and watching a seond-hand that moves smoothly around instead of in increments is kind of fascinating and soothing.You do have to be into keeping up with the fact that it's not going to keep the time if you let it sit. That's how they work. Movement winds them. They are VERY accurate once wound. But if you let it sit for a day or two you will need to reset it. I guess that's part of the appeal of auatomatic watches and I learned that most 'expensive' watches - at least it's my understanding - are automatic/manual watches and not quartz. I didn't know that. I guess it's because a 'real' watch has all of the parts that make a watch what it was orignally in terms of all of the internal parts. Not some computer chip.There is something very gratifying about hearing it wind as you move your wrist around.I plan to buy more of the Orient brand in the future.

We had a battle with thrush, so everything gets washed on hot, and these shrank big-time.  Afterwards, they were a bit small for my daughter's hands.

The whole compression aspect of this product is a bit trumped up, but it certainly does restrain things in a way I found really helpful. There's something oddly satisfying about opening up a suitcase and seeing it all neatly organized. Is it worth $23 for each of these? Depends on how much you want that feeling, I guess.

Before I came across this one, I had never considered buying, or remember ever even seeing a \"flap hat\" before. (Except on the National Geographic Channel). It just so happens that on the particular day that I spotted it, it was one of those god awful hot days where the sun was open for business and relentless. I actually decided to buy it for protection from the sun while fishing in the summer here in New England.  I have several places along the rocky coast that I enjoy salt water fishing.  Unfortunately just about all of them are in places where you have no protection from the broiling sun simmering down on you.  Large floppy fishing hats are ok, but they provide no real protection on your neck, which is where I seem to take the most beating.  This desert hat seemed just the right solution.  I will admit that I felt a little weird the first few times I wore it. Nobody else around seemed to have one. I even felt funny just trying it on in the store.  But after the first couple of trips to the coast here, I neither cared nor even gave a second thought to how I looked.  The flap not only does the job of keeping the sun off your neck, but also keeps you feeling cooler overall. I found it an extremely comfortable fit, and of a good quality that will last for years.  I believe that it will keep anyone cooler that has either a job or a leisure activity that requires them to be under a direct sun for any length of time.  Like the other reviewer here, I got lots of comments about it from other fisherman and passersby.  I gave them all the same recommendation I am giving you.

So she is the perfect age for a toy that encourages her to sit up.She absolutely loves the mirror, and the flashing lights captivate her. She's not very good yet at buttons - it's a complete accident when she hits them (and then startles a little, looking around, trying to figure out what the sudden noise is). My 3 year old likes to help her with this aspect (see video and there is a photo attached as well).  One thing I don't like is how loud it is when they press the keyboard. I thought it would be separate keys but it's one piece that depresses no matter which key you touch (and a little baby face pops up in the mirror area).So you really have one rotating bit (on the guitar), one keypad, one round button, and one pull button.  All trigger music or sounds (depending on your setting).  Then you have the microphone, which is basically a rattle.  There is a high/low button. My baby doesn't really seem to enjoy the music, even if I dance with her a little.UPDATE: she's had this for a month and she still enjoys it, and now understands how to make things happen purposely. The only difference is that the amount of time she spends before losing interest has gradually shortened. Her favorite item is the rotating ball on the guitar.  Also - she's sitting up like a champ now.DECEMBER UPDATE: She is 9 months old and still plays with this. She is going through the \"mommy and daddy can't walk away from me\" phase and this is one of the only things that helps us walk away without having her cry.  My 3 year old is more attuned to the music and loves pressing the keyboard to hear the keyboard, the drums to hear the drums added to the music, etc.FEBRUARY UPDATE: She is now two weeks from her first birthday and she plays with this more than ever. She crawls now but until this weekend could not pull herself up to standing. I'm happy to say that she did so for the first time using this toy!  She loves playing the buttons and now jumps up and down to the beat.  She loves it when we help her stand next to it and she will hold herself up.  It is so sturdy it doesn't budge at all, we have absolutely no worries that it will tip over or even slide out from under her.  First it helped her learn to sit, now it's helping her learn to stand!

Over the years, I have gone through numerous shoes and brands.  I had recently gave Saucony a try and within 20 miles of running with it I have developed ITBS.  It was quite painful.  Had just spent money on buying the pair of Saucony, I wasn't about to sink in more money for another pair, but I knew I wanted to give Asics a try again as I used to run on Nimbus.  I knew I wanted a light shoes, as I run maybe 10+ miles per week.  Latest iterations of Nimbus and Cumulus are very nice shoes, and they are made for high arch, under-pronator and moderate heel-striker like myself but they were too heavy for my taste.  Since I wasn't about to run any serious distance I wanted to stick with lighter runners.  Then came upon Gel-Lyte 33 at a clearance rack at a local store.  $19.95 was the price. I couldn't pass it.  It was going to be the cheapest pair of running shoes I've ever paid for or just a daily shoes.  Same night, I went for a run.  Up until the day before trying out the Asics,  I was feeling the pain on from ITBS on my left side.  Anyways, the shoe felt immediately better on my feet.  What surprised me was the cushioning on this light shoes.  Not only I didn't feel any pain while running, but my feet felt even better after the run.  I am not sure how long this pair will last me but I'd be happy with 200-300 miles.  Although I would've liked little more arch support for high arch person like me, but I was happy with the shoes over all.

I wore this casually, but I did try it on a few different ways and it could easily be day or night wear depending on your shoes and or accessories.

Not black, mind you, just a dark brown punctuated by black stitching holes.I was really hoping that this belt was true to what I see on my monitors, or even a touch lighter as one of the reviewers noted (though, in fairness, another reviewer said \"darker!\"). I suspect both could be correct, and there's just some color natural variations over successive production runs.Between this and a recent jacket purchase on Amazon, I'm learning my lesson that I need to see these colors in person to judge accurately (in my defense, that supposedly blue coat I ordered was most definitely grey!!).The belt is a bit more than 1/8\" thick, and though it appears supple in the tightly wrapped coil as pictured, it actually quite rigid and even springy when squeezed while wrapped into a more typical 6\" coil. The edges are completely black, with the exception of the brown stitches being slightly proud of the brown face and therefore being visible when viewed from the side, and the black side is entirely without visible stitching. The buckle is of good but not great weight (I've seen better, I've seen worse), and the \"keeper loop\" that the free end of the belt is tucked into is just a tiny bit thin with a bit of a sharp interior edge to it (that could eventually scrape the finish of the belt).If I was purchasing this belt to wear with jeans or casual clothes, I'd probably keep it. But trying to match the hue of a pair of shoes I wear to work, I'm afraid, missed the mark by a good amount -- probably due as much to the color accuracy of my monitor as anything else. I hope Amazon doesn't think I'm abusing their return policy! I'm going to have to go pay extra at the store for this purchase, just to ensure I get the color I want....and just a quick that my 3-star rating is not based on the color disparity, but on my impressions of the overall quality of the belt & buckle compared to other belts I own.", "label": "neutral"}, {"text": "I am satisfied with this purchase.

As you can guess, I haven't really used the watch yet but am hopeful that it runs as well as every other Timex I have owned.", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "I'd like to start off by saying that this shirt is made out of pretty thick and durable cotton.  I was expecting it to be cheap and thin but the nice material was a pleasant surprise, especially from this company (I don't mean that in a mean way though because the clothes are very reasonably priced and cheap material is to be expected).  The lace on the shirt is very edgy but the graphic is lacking.  The skull on the front is smaller than the one in the picture.  In the picture, it looks as if the skull takes up the majority of the shirt but in reality it takes up maybe 60% of the front.  It looks a bit silly to be honest.  In the photo, the skull starts about two inches from the neckline and stretches down to 5 inches from the hem.  But really it is like 4 inches from the neckline and 10 inches from the hem.  I don't know if it is because the shirt in the photo is a smaller size or what but I am not too pleased with this.  Another thing is the fit.  I knew it would be like a medium from reading the reviews but it has NO shape whatsoever.  I am hoping it will shrink a bit in the wash and hug some curves but we will see (I also worry that the skull will fall apart if I put it in the dryer).  I am 5'1 110 lbs. and the shirt fits me like the model on the shoulders but it goes down to my mid thigh which is not very flattering when it is so shapeless.  I have pretty large breasts for my size (32 D) and this shirt falls straight down from them, making me look like a board that is 20 pounds heavier.  I think I will do what another reviewer said and use it for sleeping/lounging considering it is not worth the money to send it back.  I think if you were 5'5 or taller and had a skinny little body, this shirt would be very flattering but it looks so unflattering on a petite/curvy body.", "label": "neutral"}, {"text": "My husband loses his all the time.

However, it offers some nice advantages over most others, with only a couple drawbacks. I wore mine for two tours in Iraq and it performed perfectly. Not that I truly ever relied on the Comp-Baro-Alti features, because we always had other more advanced devices for that. But it was reassuring to have those capabilities on my wrist at all times. And the basic time, stopwatch, alarm and timer functions were used often and performed well.Pros:User replaceable battery - very helpful in the field and easy to do, saves money.Broad array of functions - easy to manipulate the various features with a little practice and reading the manual.Very accurate - the watch loses very little time over the months and years, good quartz movement.Good water resistance - not a dive watch, but it holds up well, even under several meters of water, which I've done.Comfortable despite its large size - pretty light weight and a large, comfortable band.Easy to read - large face, big numbers.Attractive design - very distinct look.Cons:Not solar-atomic (like Casio Pathfinder) - however, battery is easily replaced and the quartz movement is very accurate.Thicker case - more so than the Casio PAW1300, but not too bad.Bottonology - the button function layout is different than most Timex and Casios, but isn't too hard to figure out.Price - higher than many, but not excessive for what you get.Overall, despite the drawbacks referenced above, I highly recommend the Suunto X-Lander and I would assume the other Suunto models are also good.

They take embroidery well and take heat transfers pretty well too (but you can expect some peeling if not washed and dried with care - best inside out).The polos are soft and feel pretty hefty when you get them.  I have washed mine 5 times though and as a uniform shirt it is not bad but the material seems a little more prone to snags and wear than I expected.  With the 5.11 name and the great stitching on this shirt it's really not bad.  In fact the stitching is so reinforced and good that I expect the stitching to hold up longer than the material for the shirt itself.How could 5.11 improve this shirt?  I think if they were to create a blend or weave of material that wears a little better and is less prone to snags.  Considering I bought one of these for non-uniform wear in black to wear with jeans, I will better be able to assess how it will stand up to a non-work environment.  I also found the price of $25 for a black version of this polo outstanding since they sell for $35 on the 5.11 site.  The price was great with Amazon Prime shipping thrown in, so I couldn't resist.This is definitely a great polo with great stitching, a nice fit and potential ... there is something about the softness though that makes me wonder about long-term durability.

Comfortable, for the most part. It feels like it should be snug enough to stay up, but...Here's the thing:The padding (which is the least of my concerns) is not really padding, more like a shape-giver. I will not put the padding in the wash, for fear it will fall apart. The slots for the padding are really wide, like big pockets. You could put an iPhone in there with room to spare. This also means that you have to make sure the &#34;pad&#34; is in the right spot. Once it is there, it does not move a whole lot, which is good, otherwise you could end up looking a bit... odd.This is the one that matters: The bandeau itself does not stay up. At first, I thought this might be because of my job, which tends to require a lot of movement, especially on busy days. I was also wearing a bra under it. I was really thankful that the one day I wore the bandeau to work, I was wearing it under a shirt that only needed it so I didn't accidentally flash a customer if I forgot and bent the wrong way, causing the shirt to droop open. During my day, I was frequently pulling the bandeau up, and at one point, it actually fell completely off my chest. This is where I was grateful that my shirt was a full coverage shirt. So. If you have an active job or activity you were thinking of using these for (dancing, waitressing, barista, bartender), this may not be the item for you.I later tried wearing the bandeau around my home, while I was lounging. No bra this time, to see if the bra material had aided in the slipping. I still felt like I had to pull it up more than I liked.I can see where I might have uses for it, and it might work better under one of my tighter shirts, which would help keep the bandeau up, but I will not purchase these again. As it is, if I plan on wearing them with the shirts I really purchased them for, I might end up reinforcing the bandeaus with tape.

Highly recommended if you are looking for a watch that matches all occasions.", "label": "very positive"}, {"text": "Intro:In my opinion if you like dive watches, this model is a must have.  Dive watches aren't just for diving, they make the best beater watches because they are built extra tough and the Seiko line of dive watches are built extra-extra tough.Watch Model:The watch being reviewed is the SKX009K2 which is the blue dialed pepsi bezel version.  There is another model called the SKX007K2 that has a black dial and black bezel.  When searching for this watch, you will also see a model SKX175 listed that looks identical to the SKX009.  This model number designates the model that was for the American market and the only difference is some of the markings on the case-back.Watch Movement:This model has an automatic movement in it as opposed to a battery operated quartz movement.  The automatic movement, known in Rolex circles as \"perpetual\" has a pendulum and clutch that moves when you move your arm.  This is unnoticed by the wearer.  The wearer's motion keeps the main spring constantly wound.  This particular model uses the Seiko 7S26(A or B) caliber movement.  I suspect that if you purchase this watch now you'll get the 7S26B version.  The B version has a couple of improvements over the A version and you can read about them if you do a search on it.  The 7S26 caliber movement can be compared to the Miyota (Citizen) 8215 movement found in the Invicta line of watches like the Invicta 8926 Submariner homage.  Both movements have 21 jewels, and both are non-hacking.  But, the Myota can be manual wound and the Seiko cannot.  The Seiko will wind in both pendulum directions and the Myota only winds in one pendulum direction.  Both movements have about the same accuracy and same power reserves.  For those of you that are environmentally conscious, this is the \"greenest\" type of watch movement.Watch Bracelet:The bracelet is a stainless steel jubilee style bracelet.  The name \"jubilee\" comes from Rolex and is an iconic bracelet found on the Rolex Datejust and Day/Date models.  The Seiko bracelet is actually a very good quality bracelet given the price point of this watch.  The center links are folded, but the ends are solid.  This makes a very solid yet light bracelet that is very comfortable and strong.  Seiko also sells a very comfortable rubber strap for this watch that is not too expensive.Watch Size:The watch is right around 40mm without the crown.  With the crown it's around 43mm.  The crown is at the four o'clock position which makes is very comfortable.  The watch is around 13mm thick.  The width and height are important numbers to determine if a watch will feel balanced on the wrist.  The Seiko numbers are very good for providing a well balanced feel on the wrist.  The lug width is 22mm which is a common width for dive watches.  This means that you can find a lot of aftermarket straps and bracelets that will fit this watch if you want to experiment.Watch Case:The case is a combination polished and brushed stainless steel.  This combination is a time tested classic look.  The shape of the case has smooth lines with no pointy or pokey areas on the watch.  The case reminds me of the way the Japanese create a sense of ergonomics like no one else can.  The uni-directional bezel is a double coin edge type that is both functional and great looking.  It has a glow in the dark flat oyster at the twelve o'clock position.  The crown is at the four o'clock position and screws down.  There is a rubber gasket in the crown so that when it is screwed down it will make the watch \"water proof.\"  The case also has a crown protector which creates a barrier from damage.  This is imperative on a beater tool watch.Watch Face:The face is a strikingly nice dark blue color.  The hour markers are large dots with differentiators at the six, nine, and twelve o'clock positions.  These markers are coated with a luminescent material (Lumibrite) that glows in the dark.  When looking at the watch in pitch black conditions, it is totally readable.  The hands are iconic of this watch.  The most striking is the minute hand.  It is large and draws the eye to it.  This is important when diving because you are most concerned with the number of minutes you've spent down.  The seconds hand is identifiable because of the lollipop at one end so it is unmistakable in low light conditions.  All the hands are glow in dark.  It has a day/date display that can display either English or Spanish, and is highly readable.  The crystal is made out of a Seiko proprietary material known as \"Hardlex.\"  Most watches have crystals that are made out of either mineral or sapphire.  Mineral crystals have the benefit of being flexible so they can take a knock without breaking, but they scratch easy.  Sapphire crystals are virtually impossible to scratch without a diamond, yet they are not flexible so they can shatter.  Hardlex is somewhere in between and performs very well in this regard.Summary:Perhaps this watch can be considered as one of the all time greatest watches at any price?", "label": "very positive"}, {"text": "... and it's comfy.

I didn't want to fuss with laces or furry trim that would get mucky.I had an older version of this boot for over 10 years, finally wore a hole into the sole.  Thought I'd try the Kamik Canuck boot for a slight change, but ?!!  it was gigantic and super clunky (and I'm used to clunky, with my old boots).  No one could help me figure out if I had a pair of men's 7 packed into the women's 7 box, so I just returned them.I ordered the Greenbay and they fit SOOOOO much more snug.  Definitely true to size in length.  And, they are much less clunky looking than the Canuck boot (especially since the Canuck was possibly a men's 7).  The insulation layer doesn't have any fancy foil heat reflective layer, but they are definitely very warm.  It's quite a thick layer of plain black insulation that doesn't show from outside the boot like the red insulation of the Canuck does (when looking from above, unless you bother cinching the top tight).  Once the boot is worn for a while, I'm sure the felt insulation will pack a bit thinner and the foot of the boot will be roomier.The only problem I have with these is that where the rubber is sewn to the fabric on one boot bends in somewhat - not enough to look funny, just enough to rub and rub and rub over my ankle bone.  Not sure hard rubber softens and breaks in the way leather would, so not sure if I'm keeping these either.Anyway, lesson is that Kamik boots need to be tried on in person.  Either it's the wrong size in the right box, or the molded rubber part can be quirky and uncomfortable.

Their shoes are well made.  They're comfortable.  They're adjustable, so you can change the fit as your feet change shape during the day. They hold up well and you hold up well walking in them.  I can destroy a 'good' (expensive) pair of shoes in 3 days to 6 weeks.  I've had my oldest TEVA sandals for 10 years.The best TEVAs have leather uppers and leather insoles, with fairly smooth walking soles.  Their old faithfuls are being re-issued with gummy (sticky) soles, which don't work well for me.  These sandals have a good, shock-absorbing sole with some 'gripping.'  Not ideal, but they're workable.  The straps are adjustable and plentiful, to really support the foot.  They're cute and strappy, in nifty colors, well suited to dressier beachwear.  As a kid I never dreamed I would be able to wear non-orthopedic shoes someday.  These are a dream come true.TEVA as a whole is a 5-star shoemaker. Their leather sandals are 5+.  This shoe, with its man-made sole, can cause your feet to sweat and peoples' noses to wrinkle when you kick them off.  That is not 5, but 3 star.

I read several of the reviews prior to purchasing; all the negative, as there were so few (at this date,) which includes the three star video, and decided that I'd order them.  I was hesitant because shoe/clothing fit is touchy but since I already own and love Doc Martins I gave these a whirl.  They are too narrow.  There is no arch support.  I wish there was a measuring chart for these shoes. Maybe Europe's standards regarding width of shoes is different than the USA's?  I even tried going up a size (as there are no half sizes) from what I normally wear in Docs but that didn't help. (I really wanted them to work!)Apart from the fit, I thought the fabric of the shoe was a bit strange. It looks like coated canvas; stiff without the natural bendability of fabric. I wonder if had they fit that would have made them chafe around the ankle.My honest advice is, if possible, try these on before you buy.  I bought them because: trying them on was not an option for me, I own other Docs that fit great, and the design (black/floral) fit my purpose.I just thought of this; I wear Converse hi-tops and love them.

They're incredible for fishing.  The polarization distorts colors a bit, which is an advantage for fishing.  I can see channels, colors, and movement very clearly.

These are my second pair of such pants, with the first pair lasting me ~15 years.  These pants will definitely fit the bill if you are looking for lightweight, waterproof, reasonably priced nylon pants and they will most likely last you a number of years.  The only minor complaints I have are that they are quite noisy when you are walking in them and that the buttons at the bottom, while well intentioned, interfere with walking and bang against your ankle as you are doing activities, particularly if they are unfastened.

I ran many half marathons and a full marathon in the original Pace Glove (all on pavement) and never had anything but wonderful experiences with them.I was devastated (no exaggeration) to learn that the original Pace Gloves had been replaced, and was very hesitant to try the new version. I took my first run tonight and here are my initial thoughts (at least if you were an original Pace Glove fan as I am):1)The Pace Glove 2 seems to be much stiffer through the midsection and less flexible. I'm hoping I can break them in to where they feel more glove-like and less shoe-like.2) They seem longer and do not fit as snugly as the original.3) The arch area seems to be misplaced... the built-up area which is suppose to be around the arch actually hits the padding of my forefoot. This is annoying and I'm not sure how it will affect me on a long run.4) I'm not sure if the soles have changed but they also seem \"off\" around the forefoot area.I really wanted to love this shoe. I'm hoping this review isn't premature but, so far, I am really sad the original is gone.UPDATE(several long runs later:)Now that I've had an ample \"break-in\" period, I feel better about the shoe. The weird arch placement and squishy padding discomfort went away after the first two runs. Now, while running, I can't tell much of a difference between the new version and the original; however, when walking in the shoe it feels much looser and much less glove-like.

They were so soft and comfortable that I didn't want to send them back, so I washed them to see how much they would shrink. The arms shrank by about half an inch in the first wash.  I'm very cold-natured, but when wearing them, I was able to sit in a room at 67 degrees Fahrenheit without wearing a robe, and I wasn't cold. I decided to keep them because they were so soft and they kept me so warm.About six weeks later, I discovered that one of the seams on the leg was sewn too close to the edge, and the material tore. Since the sleeves were too long, too, I debated between getting my money back and exchanging them. In the end, I decided to exchange them.  In hindsight, I wish I would have gotten my money back. Over the year, they continued to shrink every time they were washed, until they became too small to wear comfortably.  But the thing that was the most disappointing is that they lost their soft and comfortable feel after being washed a few times.If you decide to try these pajamas this year to see if the quality has improved, then I wouldn't recommend paying full price.

You can buy a watch at the local drug store, for $15 or less that is powered by a battery and will keep better time, take rougher handling without damage.It is the technology of my first watch, where I was told to wind it very carefully because if I wound it too far, it would break.  And this one will too, as many here have posted.  The 'crystal' is plastic and will scratch easily.So I unpacked the watch which includes careful instructions on winding.  I followed it carefully, winding very gingerly after 25.  At about 28 I could feel greater resistance, and I stopped.  This is a hunter case, which means there is a hinged cover over the face.  It is a 'demi hunter' which means there is a window in the center of the cover that lets you see the time without opening the cover. The watch is partially skeletonized, which means you can see the some of the mechanical works.  The black hands can be seen easily through the window.  The cover is stamped with decorative design around the outer edge and large roman numerals to make it easier to note the time without opening the cover.The back is covered with a design similar to the front.  The inside of the cover is marked with overlapping round swirls that is sometimes called 'machine turning'.The inside dial is white, with smaller roman numerals.Accuracy?  I compared this watch with a 130 year old Waltham that belonged to my grandfather, and a Chinese quartz hunter case Elgin given to me by my daughter when she graduated from college, 19 years ago.  The Waltham usually lives in a glass dome on a book shelf and has been wound perhaps once every few years since my father gave it to me 40 years ago.  When I first got it, a local watch technician cleaned and lubed it. I set the time for each of them against a Casio light powered, radio controlled wrist watch.  The two mechanical watches were difficult to set to the exact second--the second hand did not stop when the stem was pulled out to set the time.  So I noted how many seconds each differed from the Casio at the start of the week test period, then left them sitting on a shelf in the vertical.  I soon learned that the Waltham needed winding twice a day, so it did not run continuously for the seven day observation period.  Neverthess, this morning it was six and a half minutes slow according to th Casio.  The Elgin was right on the money.  The Charles-Hubert was 5 minutes fast.  Surprise to me, the minute hand did line up nicely with the minute mark on the dial when the second hand was at 12.  This is frequently off on much more expensive watches.Five minutes in seven days? Do you really need more than this?  When you wind it each day, set it also--against your cell phone, the tv weather/news channel or almost anything in the world around us.The fun of this watch is in the process of removing it from the pocket, clicking open the case, carefully closing the case, and returning it to the pocket.

Now that I'm over 50, the opposite is true. Age, gravity and weight have made my upper section look like one big blob. I used to have a thin waist; now it appears non existent! I decided I needed a lifting bra to separate my bust from my waist again. The ones I've tried, however, made me look like Nurse Diesel from the movie High Anxiety: pointing straight out as opposed to perking me up! So I realized I not only needed lift but some minimizing as well. Being a 40C, I didn't want a lot of minimizing though. Due to Amazon's liberal return policy on clothing, I decided to try four different minimizing, lifting bras.The Vanity Fair Age Defying Lift bra (this one) was the best of the lot. It was the only one of the four that had some light padding. I didn't want any show through if I wore a t-shirt so some type of lining was essential. The straps are comfortable and the band only has two eye hooks which I prefer as opposed to the wide bands with three. The lift gives me more of a youthful silhouette and the minimizing feature makes me look trimmer without appearing flat chested. I can actually see my waist again! It is also a very smooth look -- perfect for t-shirts. For me, this bra is a winner!The Bali Live it up bra (3353) had no lining which was the major drawback. The cups were also a little too loose at the top so the look was not as smooth due to that. It lifted and minimized well without making me look flat chested. I liked the wide comfort straps but not the three hook band. It might have worked in a smaller cup size if it had some light padding.The Bali Passion for Comfort bra (3385) also had no lining, allowing for too much show through.

I have three lobe piercings on one ear and two on the other (I am considering one more on each side) and they look beautiful next to each other. The casing and posts are strong and durable.One thing about these earrings is that the stones are shaped in the true shape of diamonds (not a flat back) which is desirable however as the size gets larger they protrude pretty far out from your ear and the casing doesn't hold them flat against your ear which causes them to droop a little.Highly recommend these.UPDATE: I still think these are beautiful but the silver has proven to be very cheap despite it being very shiny and beautiful. With average wear and gentle treatment these earrings have tarnished horribly with parts being black and other parts being browned.

We ordered the size small (4-6).  On her, it looked nothing like the picture in terms of fit.  The black tulle that should be near the knees was below my daughter's feet. I would have trimmed it.

I was going to put a cotton shirt underneath but then all of a sudden it just felt like maybe this wasn't the right costume for us.  I wanted it for 2 events: Halloween party and then her pirate themed birthday. One look at those silky white sleeves and I knew I'd only get one use out of this.  Also, there was a chemical smell. Not enough that I would have sent it back knowing we'd be using it outside, but enough that I would not have let her keep it with her dress up clothes.  Finally: GLITTER. All over the skirt, and then all over my floor.  Looking back at the picture I see the \"sparkle\" but had thought that was the design on the tulle, not loose glitter.Once again, beautiful costume!

Can I see?FITThe temples (arms) have a little spring action in them. I really like that in sunglasses. It allows a more flexible fit for many different head sizes and doesn't cause me any headaches.EYE PROTECTIONThese sunglasses are marked UV 400, which means it protects against both UVA and UVB rays. That's important to me. I don't wear any sunglasses unless they provide full protection.The lenses are dark, darker than my old standby sunglasses, and the mirrored lens help reflect the bright rays.CLARITYI can see well enough to drive, but my vision is affected enough to notice. It's subtle. I can see, but I have to check to see if I can see well. In bright sunlight, it's not a problem. Other times, when it's bright enough that I want sunglasses but not the most intense light (I'm sensitive to light), the decreased clarity bothers me.OVERALLThese sunglasses win in every department and would receive a four or five star rating for everything except clarity.

Cindy in sunny Florida", "label": "very positive"}, {"text": "I have never worn New Balance shoes before, but I have developed plantar fasciitis and am looking for a moderately-priced pair of walking/hiking shoes that are supposed to be good for people with heel pain.Obviously, in this situation it would be best to get fitted by a trained salesperson in a store that offers a range of brands and styles.  However, the nearest such place is over 60 miles away, so I thought I'd see what I could get via Amazon.The first two pairs of New Balance hiking shoes I tried ended up not fitting at all.  I had chosen them on the basis of customer reviews and the shoes' appearance, and I did not understand at the time (because the Amazon descriptions do not explain this) that New Balance uses several different kinds of shoe lasts (forms/bases/models) to accomodate differently-shaped feet.  The shoes I had ordered were designed to fit a foot that has a different shape to mine.I went to the New Balance website to learn more about the sizing options.  I had to dig around quite a bit on their site before I understood the intricacies of their lasts and their shoe styles.In a comment attached to my review, I will post some informative internet links that clearly explain the New Balance shoe range.  I hope this is helpful to someone.---Note that the last that this women's 978 walking shoe is built on is the OL-1, with a narrow heel, higher instep, deeper toebox, and wider forefoot.Additionally, on a specialist New Balance retailer's website, they advise that this particular model of shoe (978) is apparently 1/2 size smaller than the normal New Balance shoe is (and the normal New Balance shoe is apparently 1/2 size smaller than most other shoe brands' shoes), so in this style they recommend that people order a full size bigger than their \"street shoe\" size.  I called them on the phone to confirm that I was understanding the website instructions for this style correctly and they said I was.  (I will post a link to that web page in the comments area below my review.)  So I ordered a full size larger than I ordinarily would.These shoes arrived today, but they don't work for me.Positives:-Looked nicer than I expected them to, based on the photos I could find of them online.-Aren't as clunky/chunky as I thought they might be.-Aren't as heavy as I thought they might be.-The upper is softer and more pliable than I had expected it to be (since it is entirely made of smooth leather).-The heel fit snugly, which is what I need.-This style is waterproof and sturdy.-The top-of-ankle area felt pretty cushioned, which I was concerned about, since sometimes high-top hiking boots can be inflexible in that area.Negatives (for my foot):-The front of the shoe feels all wrong for my foot.  I don't know if it's the bigger toebox, bigger forefoot, or what, but there is too much space up there.  Even though my toes felt like they were floating (not in a good way), when I tried to push my foot forward about 1/6th of an inch to approximate how going a smaller size down might feel (according to New Balance, that is the difference in length between their women's shoe sizes), my toes were too close to the edge of the shoe. So the last is probably wrong for me.-The footbed felt wrong for my foot - in terms of the stability bars, cushioned areas, and so on.  When walking in them, the feel was okay to my heel and midfoot, and then suddenly at the tail end of my step where my toes would start to push off from the ground, in the forefoot area the shoe noticably dipped down, which was a little destabilizing to me.  I don't know if this is a design feature that is deliberate, or it only feels this way because the last is not a good fit for my foot, but it doesn't feel good to me.  (I know it's not a necessary feature of orthopedic-\"lite\" types of shoes because I have purchased some Fitflop shoes in the last 2 weeks and their tremendously-supportive footbeds do not do that.)I am losing hope that I will find a New Balance walking/hiking shoe that does work for me.However, I appreciate Amazon's easy shoe return policy!", "label": "negative"}, {"text": "I have these belts in a variety of colors, and have been extremely pleased with the quality and large selection of colors&#8230;and you can't beat the price!

While some of these might be chalked up to matters of personal preference in watch choices and wristwear: the non-working chronograph functions of this watch relegate it to an immediate 1-star rating.The non-functioning chronograph makes this watch essentially dead on arrival. Avoid.Using a combination of the included instructions, instructions found in online discussion forums and video sites, three users in our house attempted to successfully reset the three chronograph dials on this watch for more than an hour...with no luck.Other issues with this watch:-The face is difficult to read. Between the natural glare of the crystal and highly reflective surface, this watch is difficult to read in artificial light.-Included instructions are not for this specific model, but for *ALL* Invicta models. You get to figure out which parts apply to your watch.-Sheer mass. The band is thick, the body is thick, and the watch weighs in at just over 11 ounces (a major league baseball is just over 5 ounces). If you are wanting to build some asymmetric arm strength...wear this model on just one side for a while.-According to the included instructions, the outer \"diver's scale\" bezel can be rotated with the help of a \"pusher\" at the watch's 9 o'clock position. While there is a circular button at there, it has no apparent function. The bezel could be turned only manually (and only in one direction). The black on black index markings for this scale are tough to read in daylight. I pity the diver trying to read it underwater.-Pricing games. This watch arrived with a tag indicating an MSRP of $1295..but your favorite online search tool will show it's sold everywhere for about 10% of that. Who is Invicta trying to kid with this?I'm not normally a watch wearer, and have never been bitten by the bug that moves otherwise reasonable men to seek bigger, heavier (and often, more expensive...sometimes *much* more expensive) watches. This watch has done nothing to change that opinion.This watch arrived nicely packaged, and that was the high point of its performance. Once out of the box, it was a clear failure as a quality watch.

It took me 2 tries though, let me explain. These boots are definitely not all made the same, at least not the Oiled Suede ones. The first pair I got did not resemble the color pictured at all. It was a dark brown with no color variations, not attractive at all. The reason I ordered this pair was because of the color. They slipped right on but the right foot was definitely tighter than the left (same problem as another reviewer) and didn't feel good at all especially on the heal, way too tight.I decided to order another pair just to see if the color and fit would be any better. I'm glad I did. The color on the second pair is BEAUTIFUL!!! It's that warm, old-looking, worn in brown, with nice color variations, very much like the picture. They really look like an old favorite pair of boots, I envision Ralph Lauren (or his wife Ricky) walking around in these at his ranch in Colorado. I went to put my foot in and boy was it hard, a bit of a shock since I slipped right into the first pair. I put on a thin dress sock and with a bit of persistence (just a bit) I got them on. It's strange because getting them on was a lot harder than the other pair but they feel and fit great once on (unlike the other pair).

Almost everywhere, I see these for 30 dollars, so Amazon has by FAR the best deal regarding price.I've gotten Rocket Dog's in the past, but not this style.  I was a little hesitant regarding sizing as sizes don't seem standard any longer.  It's either some companies are doing \"vanity\" sizing (for instance, I got a pair of another brand in a 7, even though I usually take an 8-8.5 and they fit like an 8)or are basing on some strange standard that isn't, well, standard.  The last pair of Rocket Dog's I got in a different style, the 7 fit like this 8 does, so go figure.I read reviews here with more saying to SIZE UP, than size down, and I even called Rocket Dog's customer service.  I'm SO GLAD I went with the 8!  If you usually wear a 7.5-8 in flats, DEFINITELY DO THE 8 in this style!  If you wear 8.5, I would definitely size up to the 9.I read a couple reviews saying these are very wide.  I have a B width foot, but on the narrow B side, and I don't find them too wide at all.  If you're a B width, these should do nicely.  Unless you have VERY narrow feet, I think you will like the width.LOVE the cushiony feel.  I need some support and many flip flops don't offer that. These do.  I sometimes walk six blocks into town, walk around, walk back.  Doesn't sound like that much, but I needed something where my feet had some cushion under them.  I'm over fifty and can walk just fine, but notice my bones appreciate support!  I also like they didn't rub from the moment I put them on.  I can't say that about most other flip flops, many take a little breaking in.OH and regarding the \"SQUEAK\" others mentioned, I have been walking around my living room in them and there is very little squeak (I was expecting it to sound like there were mice on my feet from some of the reviews) and I'm sure within a day it will be gone completely.

However, I ran into a bit of a problem with my order.There's little more to say about this jacket that hasn't already been said. I've had Carhartt jackets in the past and I'm familiar with their quality products. This jacket is on the spendy side for a jacket without a hood, but probably well worth the money. The only issue is color. I wanted the Gravel (gray) with the black collar as shown in the picture. However when I put it in the cart, the color scheme changed (gravel with black shoulders, collar and sleeves). I sent an email to Amazon to find out which picture is correct, and I got the usual \"call center\" responses, with the \"tell the customer what he wants to hear and worry about the consequences if I make a mistake later\" mindset - including the bad grammar and poorly written emails.I couldn't get a straight answer after 3 emails - I finally gave up and figured it probably didn't make much difference anyway, because I actually liked them both. But - obviously not the point. And, after I was assured I could return it without any cost to me at all (which is total nonsense, because the last time I tried to return something to amazon for a mistake in the listing they limited the return shipping refund to $4.48 when it cost me about $12 to ship. You can't ship anything for $4.48 these days!Just beware. - Otherwise, as I said - this jacket is great. Warm, comfortable and flexible, yet relatively lightweight. If there's a negative, as a couple reviewers have already pointed out, is they want another $18 to $42 bucks for the hood, which is a little ridiculous.Most jackets like this come with removable hoods, especially in this price range. And, the price for the hood depends on which color you want - which is nonsense. The more popular the color, the more they'll soak you for the hood.  I'll probably pass on it - I don't like these marketing games and it makes the jacket too expensive for what you get out of it.I rated this purchase 3 stars rather than 5 because of the inaccurate listing and the unprofessional communique I got from Amazon concerning the product  - not because of the quality of the jacket. I should have been able to get a straight answer to my question and without any follow up emails.A year later: I really like this jacket.

It is kind of like a Kelly bag, which you, me, and everyone's second cousin would love to have. But a satchel shape is really hard to work without structure.  It's very soft, and has no internal structure to hold it up -- so it won't actually stand up like it's doing in the picture here.  This is not the worst thing in the world.  It's actually big enough to be a bookbag, great for a student or teacher, and can hold books and notebooks and folders -- but again, without any internal structure, it's going to be pretty darn heavy.  I haven't tried filling it up all the way yet, so it does sag a bit.  Again, not the worst thing in the world -- just not at all like a Kelly bag.  If that shape is what you're after, I would say keep looking.  If you just want a very nice looking soft bag that is big enough for books, this could work.  Just don't expect it stand up.

Here is what she had to say about the product:>>>THIS IS AMAZING! I loved working with this product! I picked up on the words and phrases very quickly, and it was fun to do. They show you pictures and then show you the French word, pronounce it for you, and then you say it. It reviews the same things in different ways so practicing the words is not dry and boring. You can do it on your time and at your own pace. It also teaches you the four areas of language - speaking, listening, reading and writing. It offers activities that have you practice a combination of skills (reading and writing over listening and speaking), as well as lessons that focus on just one of the skills. I would highly recommend this product to my fellow peers!

Plenty of room for the toes with my wide wide feet.  Still made in America!", "label": "very positive"}, {"text": "Taking this watch out of the box and putting it on was a great thrill.  Then I took out the instruction booklets! Oh, what a grief.  Tiny print, three separate books English, French, and Spanish.  The book in English is very specific, however, it is difficult to read with such small print.  Then I got the brilliant idea to go to the Casio website and see if they had this booklet in PDF.  What a stroke of luck, it was there at the site, I downloaded it and put it on my computer screen so that I could read it.It only took me 1/2 hour to figure out how to set the time!  Just the simple time of day!  You have to set it by using Latitude and Longitude.  Look that up on Google for your town and you are in?  No, the mechanism in the watch takes you to a different city.  If that city is in your time zone, like I found, then the watch automatically sets the time.  I could not get it to locate my city.  I used the GPS to locate my Lat and Long which did not work well with the watch and that is why I went to Google.I wore the watch for a day and then decided it would be nice to use some of the other functions.  This watch has a lot of them, but I only wanted to set the temperature function.  Well, this was interesting.  It seems that if you are wearing the watch you get your body temperature, the instruction booklet says to take the watch off and hang it from your backpack or waist for at least five minutes or you will just get your own temperature.  I did as instructed, but the problem was that it was in Celsius rather than Fahrenheit which I am used to.  It only took about 15 minutes by meticulously following the instructions to change it.Still haven't tackled the compass settings yet.

That pushes on my foot relatively firmly everywhree, sock that has a feel of a sweater, has a itchy feel.This turned out to be exactly that sock even though it says it is 60% wool. I thought only a thick 100% wool sock can accomplish that. This one is advertised and the package stats 60% Wool, 35% Acrylic, 5% Nylon. They are thick and fulfill the above mentioned needs perfectly. I have worn knit socks that were made from 100 wool thread. I still cannot find those anywhere, but this is closest I've ever bought.They feel strong because they are made thicker than the standard sock. My foot is size 13 and thin. After I put the sock on it fits perfectly. By that I mean, they are loose enough that I could fit a thinner sock underneath, which I often do. So this may be an advice for someone with feet of size under 11, maybe this might be too spacious.One detail. I only tested them for indoor use on carpet and wood floors. I did not wear them outside in cold weather. My feet get cold after surviving chemotherapy so I always wear warm socks these days, they are strong enough to wear as slippers at home.

My conclusion was that even within the entry level of lower end diamonds a VS 1 Clarity rating and an H-G color certification, at about 1/2 - 1 Carats set into 18K white gold(14k is to soft) all fell into a price range ranging from $1800- $2500 per ring and up. (add another $1,000 for Platinum)While searching around I didn't exclude Amazon, after all we buy virtually everything else here, and found some remarkable deals. Rings from Metal Masters kept popping up in my searches. At first I just rolled my eyes, after all how could any ring priced this low even \"appear\" to be of decent quality. But design wise I kept coming back Metal Masters.There was a brief discussion about using the money for a pair of rings or putting into our 60 year old house which we're remodeling and repairing at a snails pace. I wrote a note to Metal Masters regarding sizing and quality of the CZ crystals and received a quick and detailed response.*Note to other potential buyers - remember when ordering a \"comfort fit\" that you want a half size down. So if you wear say a 9 order an 8.5 and so on.I ordered two of these, and two of another style - another great reason to buy these is that you can afford to do just that, without having to put a couple grand down per ring as a deposit. And afford to keep them all. Both styles are terrific but for us the \"Eternity Ring\" won hands down, Wonderfully cast, Great sparkle, a beautiful timeless design - and when the ring moves in any direction you still see the stones - as their Channel set all the way around.For lack of better words all I can tell you is that we were absolutely knocked out. Especially with the Eternity ring. The Titanium is gorgeous, seamless and perfectly cast. The matte finish with it's high polish border is really stunning and that would be without the stones. With the stones? They're incredible.Channel setting has to be done by hand, shoddy work means uneven settings and loss of stones. Not the case here. Each stone is set beneath the depth of the metal, which is exactly what you want. If the stone is set to high, it'll catch on things and because not all of the stones Girdle (the sides of the stone) are braced by the metal you run the risk of pressure pushing the stones out. Diamond or not - you won't find a better quality channel setting.The setting of each and every Brilliant cut CZ is perfectly spaced and perfectly set. The rings easily compared to ones we saw costing over $2,000 apiece. The Cubic Zirconia crystals are top quality and flawless. CZ isn't new - it was discovered in the mid 1800's but wasn't introduced as an alternative to diamonds until 1976. CZ remains the number one competitor to actual diamonds today. CZ is colorless, can be cut just like diamonds, and are very hard, measuring an 8 on the Mohs scale which is harder than most gems - Diamonds measure a 10, only two points above CZ.Depending upon the cut both will refract (pull in light and bounce it around inside the stone) and reflect (beam the light out) which causes the \"sparkle\" so dim or no light = no sparkle regardless if it's diamond or CZ. As far as a look of authenticity, only an experienced  jeweler or gemologist would be able to tell the difference and that's with the help of Loupe or other magnification.This is because even the finest diamonds in the world have inclusions inside that can't be seen with the naked eye. CZ stones have no inclusions whatsoever. Ironically it's their perfection that gives them away.With all this said, these rings are an incredible buy and a wonderful alternative to diamonds. What is more, anyone who understands the horrors of diamond trafficking will have the peace of mind knowing they played no part in supporting it.The rings arrive exceptionally well packaged, each in a Metal Masters presentation box, sized perfectly and delivered with lightening speed. Add to the mix a company that's responsive and stands behind their product - you just can't go wrong.As far as durability these rings get knocked around plenty and after months still not a single scratch or loose stone.Simply a sensational piece of jewelry with an elegant, timeless design that you'll be proud to own and even prouder to wear.", "label": "very positive"}, {"text": "excelent&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;", "label": "very positive"}, {"text": "They are what to be expected !

Its piano black finish is remarkable. The viewing window is plastic, but it gives the impression of being glass. I will say that the item is furniture quality in its appearance. The interior is also commendable, it is a creme colored simulated suede/calfskin.I've owned the Kendal for approximately 45 days and I use it to wind three watches by wearing one while it winds the other two. I intentionally left one watch undisturbed on the winder for two weeks and when I removed the watch, it was perhaps 1 minute fast. The turntable does not bog down with two watches in place, it does not become unbalanced if there is only one watch in place, and it does not become unbalanced if one of the two watches is heavier. My winder does make a rubbing sound when it is on. However, when you lower the winder's lid, the sound noticeably lessens. Nevertheless, were the winder by my bed, it would be disturbing.I have two problems with the winder: (1) pillow size and (2) battery life. The pillow size is much too small for your typical male mechanical watch. The pillow measures 1 3/4\" (70 mm) long by 1 1/4\" (30 mm) wide by 1 1/4\" (30 mm) high. Each time I set my watch on the pillow, I have to adjust my watch band two holes smaller than my normal wearing size. You do this twice a day (let the band out in the morning to wear the watch and take it in at the evening to wind the watch) and you quickly become frustrated with the winder. One of my reasons for buying the Kendal was its ability to run on battery power since my closet does not have ac power. I installed two Duracell C-size batteries when I unpackaged the Kendal and they lasted approximately 30 days. I just happened to be cleaning the closet and did not hear the winder working during an hour's time.  There is no indicator on the unit that battery power is present/absent. I replaced the batteries with new Duracell and two weeks later they are dead. I've since moved the unit so that it can run ac power.In summary, this item has some great features and if you have a woman's (or early generation man's) mechanical watch I would recommend this winder. However, for a modern man's mechanical watch, I cannot recommend this winder because of its small watch pillows. I am including the pillow's dimensions because if one of the earlier reviews would have done so I would not have purchased this winder.", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "I just got this t shirt and it is already my favorite.

You read that right.  If you like a snug fit, order one full size larger, e.g. you wear size 10, order size 11, 11.5 or 12 seriously.Finally, the price.

Use cold water and whatever you do, DON'T put it in the dryer.  It will ruin it permanently.  The Le Mystere dries quickly overnight when hung on a hanger.  It fits beautifully without adding to your size.  Instead it adds shape.  It is the same bra sold by many on-line specialty shops, but it's much less expensive through Amazon.  One thing I did not like was the way it was packed; one cup was inverted into another and this temporarily deformed the cup.  I had to really work at it to get the outside material to fit the inner foam perfectly.  Never store it by inverting the cups.  It will definitely ruin it, and when you receive it, get it out of the package immediately and put it \"into proper shape\" by un-inverting the cup that the packer inverted.

However, if you are looking for a more slimline, more fashionable down coat - this may be for you. It's hard to look slim in a long down coat, but my profile is \"thin\" in this! I'm not crazy about a piece of real fox hanging onto my hood, but it does add a bit of fashion pizzazz. The fox part is removable, and the coat looks fine without (albeit more mundane). The material and construction seem moderately-high quality. The material makes moderate noise when the sleeves rub against the coat's sides (like loud leg nylons). I wish the zippered pockets were lined with a bit of fleece material to make them more cozy, but I guess they wouldn't be so super-flush, if so? The hood is designed such that it seems like it would actually stay on my head easily, without needing to snap or zip all the coat way up, which is nice if you have to dash through a bit of rain.This coat will give me another reason not to gain weight, as five pounds would definitely show with this zipped up at the waist!

It can be dressed up under slacks or with tights and a dress, or dressed down with cuffed skinnies. Looks great with almost anything. It comes in a variety of colors and materials (suede, distressed suede, leather) to suit almost everyone's personal style.COMFORT:These boots have little to no arch support, so are great gals with flat feet. If you have any hint of an arch, I'd recommend getting an insole. I have a fairly high arch and theDr. Scholls Hidden Arch Supports (Pack of 3)work great! Keep in mind that the different materials have varying levels of initial comfort (upon first wear) and breaking in times. The suedes are definitely more comfortable than the leathers, and have a significantly shorter break-in period. If you're new to wearing boots at all, stick to the suedes first, then work your way up. :)LONGEVITY:If taken care of, these boots will last forever! If you're buying leather, be sure to clean & condition them regularly (unless you're a fan of the grungy, scuffed-up look). If you're buying suede, be sure to coat them with a suede protector (the Clarks brand protector does NOT change the suede's color, unlike the Kiwi brand one).All in all, these are fabulous boots that are well worth the investment!", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "I ordered a pair of black 560 Levi's from this seller.

To illustrate my point, the case diameter is almost 2\" in diameter, the case is 3/5\" thick and the band is over 1\" wide.

It should be noted that the zebra/leopard boots are not \"mirror images\" in that the design on the right and left boots are exactly alike.  The stripe portion is on the left side of the shoe (outside of the left, on inside of the right); the spotted portion is on the right side of the shoe (inside of the left, outside on the right).  Hope you get what I mean.  If someone is looking at your left side, they'll see all zebra stripe on your feet with spots up the calf; if they look at your right side, they'll see leopard spots on your heels and up your calf and part of the zebra design on the toes.  You are viewing a left shoe in this product description.They work well in the rain and keep feet dry and are generally waterproof under normal circumstances. They are not waders, however, and you don't want to wear them fly fishing or wading in an icy stream.If you want to wear thicker socks with the boots, stay with your regular size. Size down one size if you want the boot to fit snugly on the foot with a thinner sock.  If it's rainy and cold, it may be a plus to be able to pair with thicker socks as there is no other insulation and if the shoes are to be worn out in the elements for an extended period, you will want warmth, and your regular size should easily accommodate a thicker sock, as these seem to \"run big.\"Please note that wide width sizes may want to avoid this boot due to the pointed toe design.  Best for medium width wearers.  Sizing up will not accommodate wide widths; the toe will still be too narrow.Comes with a removable liner.  You can remove and insert your own.  It's probably better to have either the liner and/or thick socks because there isn't anything else besides the rubber sole between your foot and the ground.  Again, there's no insulation, only rubber.  So while you may stay dry, you might not be warm, so the thick sock option comes into play.  Did not have any issues with the boots being too tight around the leg/calves and was able to tuck in pants with no problem.  It is better to take the measurements and determine if they will fit you, however.Easy to walk in and not bulky; they can be worn during on a commute to work (walking, parking, train, bus, etc.) and into the office without changing into other shoes (depending on the rigidity of your workplace dress code) because they are fun and stylish.  People are surprised when you tell them that they're rubber.  Of course, there is no way they could ever be mistaken for real cowboy boots, but they're stylish enough not to look like gardening galoshes or hip waders.Put them away clean, wash off any mud or debris before long-term storage, inspect periodically to be sure the rubber is supple and not dried out or cracked.  Not sure how long they will last, but past experience with rubber and rubber-soled shoes pegs it at a lifetime of ten years or so.

The color on this pair is very pleasing to the eye, and the deal for this ECCO Men's Bradley Fashion Sneaker,Coffee/Cocoa Brown,45 EU/11-11.5 M US, made the purchase a no brainer, for they are generally a lot more expensive, and is always a good thing to take advantage of an enticing sale, which in this case was almost 50% off.

Very distinct.  I was also really worried about washing it - I thought the blue would leak out and ruin my other clothes but that did not happen.  Also, it kept it's shape so it still fits awesome.

If you have wide or boxy feet, these may be worth a try (maybe not for super-wide or edemic).

The chain was looped all inside the center of the pendant around the hands and then that which wasn't inside was a knotted up, hanging off.  Pathetic.  Well, now I've had two of these and both were useless, not to mention, my friends birthday is now past, with no gift.A futher note is that many of the reviews say the chain is poor, and those reviews are absolutely right.

She recommends walking barefoot on natural surfaces as much as possible, which unfortunately is impractical for most of us, so I thought this shoe would be a suitable compromise.  I have worn it for 2 days now, pretty much all day, and I definitely feel it in my lower back.  Not  pain, but slight discomfort.  I am assuming that is is from my back getting use to the proper anteverted pelvis position, and that with continued use, this will become natural and comfortable.  I will  update in a few weeks with my progress.I also ordered these for my 81 year-old mother, who has taken to shuffling around flat-footed.

I can now run 2.5 miles in 24 minutes and am working up to run a 5k in under 30.  Not bad for an old gal.

My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine, so I ordered a pair for her as well.We've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s.  They are not as comfortable.  The arch can be \"bumpy\" or nonexistent, and they run a little small.  I wear a size 8, and the stone pair are tight on me.  Tighter than the white for some reason.  I'm sure they will get better as they break in, but I've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight.  My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them.  That never happened to me with Keds.  And I have narrow feet.  Someone with a wider foot couldn't wear these comfortably, at all.  The sneakers also don't last as long as they used to.  I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school, and one pair would last me a long time.  Now, I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear, and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable.  They don't feel as cushiony as they used to, even when brand new.  Very different.  Wearable, and I like them, but they are not as good as they used to be.  I suspect they were not made in China a decade+ ago.  I think they are made smaller than they used to be, because even looking at my feet while wearing them, I noticed they make my feet look smaller.  I like that, but, not at the expense of comfort.  I might try an 8 1/2 next time.  The white fit better for some reason, not so small.Update:  I wanted to add what happened in my experience with the stone colored sneakers.  I am downgrading this review from 4 stars to 2.They were very tight at first.  I thought I had broken them in because they felt better.  However, after wearing them several times, I noticed that my small toenails had started to turn inward a little.  I have never had foot problems in my life, and I am sure that this happened to my nails from the tight Keds.  I have not worn them since and will not wear them again.

The calf just fits, any smaller and there would be unsightly muffin top, but since they are suede they may stretch enough to get leggings in eventually. They are one of the most comfortable pairs of footwear I've ever had. The suede, in chocolate brown, is beautiful. They are pull on and I also have high insteps and arches, so there is a fair amount of struggling to get on initially but once on, they are heaven. Very toasty, too, so bring on the cool fall weather! Thinking about another pair now.", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "The shoe was okay.

I am not a fan of sneakers/athletic shoes and wanted something that wasn't completely clunky/dowdy. My trip is in a week, however, and after trying on SO many pairs of shoes, I was about to resign myself to tennis shoes. Then I found these at a local outdoor/sporting goods store, and I think I finally have my winner. I bought the black/black which is really more of a dark gray... definitely NOT a true, clear black if you're trying to match say, black pants, but they'll serve my purpose and should look fine with jeans or capris. The store also had the dark earth color, which is a sort of brownish-grey and very neutral (I actually liked it better than the black but alas they didn't have my size in stock).I have an extremely high instep but the strap on these is stretchy enough not to cause any discomfort. This is pretty big for me, as I can't wear most \"typical\" Mary Jane shoes with the straight-across strap without immediate discomfort from the strap digging into my foot. Arch support is pretty good. The footbed is not cushy by any means, but decently supportive and comfortable. I'm rather blister-prone but don't feel any rubbing or problem spots, and so I'm fairly hopeful on the blister front, even though I've only worn these around the house so far. My only complaints: like all Keens I've ever tried on, these run very wide... which is fine, but they also LOOK really wide and don't do much to minimize larger feet. The toe is EXTREMELY square, and the rubber at the front frankly makes it look even more square. Thus, not the most attractive shoe on, though definitely still passable and bounds better than athletic shoes. I just wish there was SOME sort of tapering or rounding at the toe; I believe this would make it look a lot better and cut down on the 'clunky' factor.I would also say these run slightly large, though not by a complete half size. I used to be a dependable size nine, but I think my feet have shrunk because lately I've been wearing primarily 8.5s. In these, the nine was absolutely enormous. The 8.5 felt fine, though a tiny bit long. The 8 was almost perfect but my toes JUST butted up against the front. I debated between the 8 and 8.5, but after walking around the store in both pairs, I ended up with the 8.5. They are somewhat roomy, but because of the strap, my feet stay in and I'd rather them be a little big than a little small. Therefore, I'd say if you're between sizes, size down. Otherwise, get your true size.EDIT 06/17/13:Unfortunately after walking around the house in these a bit more, I have to lower my rating to 3 stars simply because of an extremely odd comfort issue. No, not rubbing on the back, nor chafing with the strap, but rather, rubbing on the insole! So odd, and a problem I've NEVER experienced before. I think the issue is that the insole is removable, and for lack of a better descriptor, the shape of it sort of curves up at the edges, which are then a tad rough. My feet are slightly different sizes, and I suppose the insole in the left shoe sort of follows my arch enough where it doesn't rub. On the right shoe, though, the edge of the insole chafes at the bottom of my foot. I know that sounds super weird, and believe me, it FEELS super weird; I've never had a shoe rub at the bottom of my foot before! But I guess it must just be my foot shape. In any case, I'm left with the edges of the insole curling up and scratching at the bottom of my right foot in an extremely noticeable and uncomfortable way. I suppose this could be alleviated by buying some sort of insert, but my whole reason for getting these shoes was to have something comfy out of the box, so that's not really an option for me. Wearing socks could also help, but this just isn't the sort of shoe I would ever wear socks with, personally. Frankly, I think the problem might in part be the whole sizing thing-- as I mentioned before, the 8.5 was a little large, so maybe my foot doesn't hit the shoe in quite the right way. If only they made an 8.25! Anyway, unless the rough edge of the insole magically softens while I walk around the house some more (doubtful), I think I'm going to have to return these. So bummed!", "label": "neutral"}, {"text": "I'm legally blind in one eye, and the other one isn't much better. This creates some problems in telling the time, since watching the sun isn't really that practical. After my pricey Casio bit the dust because of a busted strap, I started looking for a replacement with certain requirements in mind:1. The time had to be very easy to see. Large, easy to read numbers.2. The calendar function, while less important, also had to be relatively easy to read.3. The night light on the watch had to light the time sufficiently well and all over so that I could tell when it was at 3 a.m.4. The watch controls and settings had to be intuitively obvious so I could let my fingers do all the walking necessary in less than five minutes. The teensy print in the dinky manuals manufacturers typically send with watches is impossible for me to read.5. The watch had to be fairly inexpensive. And I wanted something I could reasonably expect to last two years on one battery. When it dies, I just plan on buying another watch.I'm pleased to say that this watch meets all the above expectations, and then some. It is especially easy to read, and the night light actually makes telling the time in the dark a real pleasure. The controls are protruded buttons with large, flat surfaces that have a wonderful tactile feel and are exceptionally easy to use. It's a plus that the watch is very attractive with its decorative orange highlighting. It also survives with style my forays into the deep end of the pool at the Y.It's true that the watch doesn't have atomic timekeeping and a solar-powered battery, both of which are desirable features. But for the price, this is one very useful item that just can't be best.", "label": "very positive"}, {"text": "I like my new Eco-Drive watch and that it is WR to 200 meters, but what I don't like is the canvas band (the reason for only four stars and not five). I removed the canvas band and installed a new Nato 21mm Heavy Nylon Brushed SS Buckle - Military Green band and now I really like the watch a lot. The new green band makes the watch really pop. The other items that I liked on this watch are the luminous hands (great in any low light condition) and the oversized luminous numbers, that I am able to easily read any time of day or night. Additional features that are include that I liked are the date indicator window at 3 o'clock, the non-reflective crystal and the screw-down crown (WR 200M). Also the Eco-Drive watch system does not require any battery's is the best part just some light each day to keep the system charged up.

The 8.5 sandal is smaller than my 8.5 Keen leather shoe. The foot bed on the sandal seems to provide some arch support and I love the nice wide toe box. It also has a little give to it so it does not feel hard under my foot. I am looking forward to wearing sandals that protect my toes and also cover them from view. My toenails are not my best feature. I noticed that my doctor wears these sandals all of year round in her office so I thought I would give them a try. Her foot was injured when her horse stepped on it (she was wearing riding boots at the time, not sandals obviously) and she told me these Keen sandals are the most comfortable shoes she has ever worn even with the residual pain and damage to her foot. I have flat feet and bunions so I figured I would give these a try. I love my Keen leather shoes so I expect these sandals to become favorites as well. I like the fact that they can be worn in the water as I am often walking in creeks with my dogs and also have to walk over rocky ground down to the lake to swim. Keen brand shoes are so comfortable you can forget that you are even wearing shoes and that is how shoes should feel, completely comfortable.

They are a little stiff out of the box, but I didn't have any problems with rubbing after wearing them for long periods, and didn't feel that they were too bulky to move around in.  At 5'8\", they hit me just above mid-calf, so that probably helps.  Definitely better than the \"ducks\" I was using.  Driving in them was a little interesting.  I had to adjust the angle of my foot to press on the gas pedal and was able to manage, but would definitely be more comfortable wearing them as a passenger.

Although it is expensive, in this case, you will get what you pay for. This model of Copilot has been updated for 2014. I have the 22 inch model or medium case. It comes with a lifetime warranty that guarantees the Copilot against defects and craftsmanship forever.It is easy to access the contents of the suitcase. Seated down in an airline seat or in an airport waiting area and without getting up, I can reach in from above and access many of the pockets, including some of the inside contents by opening the top zipper. If you need to look inside the bag or pockets of the red-on-black bag (which is the one I have) it is easy to see belongings because the inside lining is a red heavy-duty material. There is also a special &#8220;slash pocket&#8221; under the large outside front pocket that yields access to the inside of the suitcase from the side, intended to be used to reach inside the suitcase when it is laying in an overhead bin&#8212;that way you don&#8217;t have to haul it out of the bin to get inside!The front zipper pocket is padded and it will hold a smaller MacBook Pro (up to 13&#8221;) and other electronic devices. If you have a larger MacBook Pro (I have a 15&#8221;) it can fit inside and then be accessed with the slash pocket described above.There are ultra-reinforced grab handles everywhere for lifting and maneuvering. There are literally handles on all sides of the Copilot; however, they are so well-designed that they don&#8217;t get in the way. At the same time, you can easily pull it out of overhead bins, taxis, wherever.The wheels are urethane skateboard wheels&#8212;very sturdy and very quiet.The aluminum double post handle is sturdy, extends smoothly, and is covered with a comfortable rubbery grip inspired by a bicycle hand grip.The outside is made of a &#8220;durable nylon and fabric reinforced tarpaulin fabric construction&#8221;. I had to look that up. A tarpaulin (or tarp) is a sheet of strong, flexible, tough material used for heavy-duty tasks.The inside is a clamshell design&#8212;two separate compartments. The top compartment is really reinforced but softer and the bottom compartment is a hard shell covered with that tarp material. The compartments are separated by mesh covers with zippers. These keep the things inside organized. There are two pockets on top of the mesh dividers on the top side for additional organization, toiletries, etc. All but these additional pockets have dual zippers.The medium Copilot is 14.6 inches wide, 21.6 inches high, 9.8 inches deep, and weighs only 6.6 pounds. It really is an amazing balance of sturdiness and light weight for travel and maneuvering.Timbuk2 bags cost more, but they are a quality product.Highly recommended.*****", "label": "very positive"}, {"text": "Just bought my first Alex n Ani bangle for my birthday.

I had to cinch them so tight just to get them to stay up, that you could see the indent on my shoulders through my dress.  This bra just lacked the overall comfort I'm used to.The push-up aspect wasn't bad.  This was my first push-up bra.  I didn't need a ton of cleavage I just needed some extra lift because my dress was very low cut.  So it worked fine for what I needed.Also, at first the straps kept coming out of the clasps holding them on.  They don't close and just slip on and off.  Eventually I was able to get this to stop, thankfully.If I hadn't already worn this bra I would return it.  In a pinch I would purchase this again, but if given more time, I would look for a more comfortable bra.", "label": "neutral"}, {"text": "I buy funny saying tees as a way to sneak something other then straight black into my son's wardrobe.

In the Summer, this includes my standard wardrobe of shorts, a tshirt and Nike sneakers.  Due to some of the medications that I am taking, I am really, really hot all of the time.  Thus, I was looking for any opportunity to keep myself cooler.  I found these shorts at my local Boscov's department store and decided to try them.I absolutely love these shorts!  They are made of cotton, but it has almost a silken feel to it.  They lay perfectly on your body -not too form fitting and don't cling to any areas that you don't want to highlight (like my stomach which hasn't been flat since I was 12 years old). They are super soft and very lighweight (the inside of the side pockets is actually mesh which allows for superior venting and coolness).  These shorts do wrinkle if not properly folded and stored but I never iron them as the wrinkles come out within minutes of wearing them.The other great thing about these shorts is that it has sun block protection built into the fabric.  They call it \"Omni\" and it is supposed to prevent the sunrays from getting through to your skin.  For me, this is not really a concern as I have a medium skin tone and tan (and rarely burn).  But, it that effect keeps me a bit cooler, than it's great.  I also noticed that it doesn't stick to my skin if it's really hot outside and I am sweating - you can't even see it on the shorts.  They are not waterproof, but dry almost instantly (I wore these on an amusement park water ride where I was drenched and they were barely wet and dried within 5 minutes!).Due to the factors that I mentioned above, I am definitely cooler when I am wearing these shorts no matter what the heat/humidity is outside.I love these shorts so much, I ordered a dozen more of them from Back Country website (cheaper than Amazon or Boscov's) in various colors.

How well it will do for you size wise depends on things like where you'll be using it and whether you pack light or not.  If you're like my friend tessa, who likes to bring her entire makeup kit when she goes on a two day trip- this is not the toiletry bag for you.  However if you're like me and want to pack only the necessities on a trip, you'll find this bag will be all you need for your travels.  This baby even handled a SIX WEEK long trip for me once! (but I also had bathroom counter space that I could use while on this particular trip)It will fit a full sized deoderant, Sunscreen, makeup/acne concealer pen, full size toothpaste & full size tooth brush, shower cap, Full size SebaMed Soap & body wash, Razor, a travel sized brush, hair ties.... and still have room to spare. These are usually all I bring on a trip so I'm no pack rat.  The best thing about this bag is not just it's ability to carry alot in a small space, but the fact that everything is so easy to access. There are lots of toiletry bags that hang that have all these levels you have to constantly zip and unzip- and if you forget to zip a layer when you fold up the bag whatever's inside it falls out and crashes on the floor.  This is only one level and all you have to do is stick your hand in and take out whatever you need.  No zippers and levels to deal with.  The one zipper inside is vertical so if you forget to zip that stuff won't fall out when you close the bag.  I've had a lot of toiletry bags and this one I just keep coming back to.  I don't understand why one reviewer says his bag didn't last.  Mine has lasted for years and has no wear and tear to it at all.  I hope the manufacturer hasn't changed the quality of the product.  And I don't get why some people are complaining about the steel hook.  This is the best part of the product.  There's no worry of it breaking or bending during your trip like other materials.  I don't think it's heavy at all.  I have another toiletry bag that is larger and it has a lousy plastic hook which I removed.

Really gaudy.\"-\"The 80s.\"-\"The chain is really thin for the pendant (considering its weight).\"-\"Why are there scratches on the pearl?\"The necklace is packed in a cheap blue box.  There are stickers on each side. If you are giving this as a gift, be aware that when the stickers are removed, some of the coloring from the box is removed as well. So, if you want to check out the gift before giving it, the stickers will betray your curiosity/diligence.  Inside the box is a little velvet pouch.

Several years ago we bought one of their divers watches for our daughter, and it was surprisingly, much more elegant than their current \"luxury\" or day to day models!This watch is big and thick (roughly 3x the thickness of my Skagen, and twice again that of a Timex).  I know that this is unnecessary having purchased Invicta watches in the past which were much more sleek, and in my opinion nicer looking.  My sense is that this particular fad is going to go the way of bell bottoms.  Though not as obvious, it is  more expensive mistake for anyone who wants a watch to last more than a season.  Even though I am fairly tall, I feel conspicuous with this on.  I wish Amazon would add thickness to their watch search categories, as that is a feature I look for, much preferring watches a fraction this heft.I know the company from experience, having several of their watches in my household, some over a number of years.  They are well made, and the company backs them with a solid warranty.  They are made with quality materials: Swiss movement, mineral crystal, nice quality build and finish.  It is water resistant (though I would not take it diving) with a finish that does not look like it will rub or wear off.  It is easy to set and easy to read, but would have been a lot more wearable and have more overall utility if they had not bowed to a fashion fad and made it so thick and heavy.It comes with a very large bracelet which can be adjusted by removing pins and a very secure clasp (and consequently could be used as a men's watch which might look more appropriate on the average person).
