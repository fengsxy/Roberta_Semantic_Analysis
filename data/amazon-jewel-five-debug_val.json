I had previously owned theWenger Swiss Military Men's 72917 Classic Field Black Dial Brown Leather Military Watchbut I lost it on a trip. Needless to say, I wanted another Wenger to replace it only this time I opted for the dial white face, instead of black. Purely a personal preference. And I am definitely not disappointed. Upon receiving the watch, I inspected it for any small little things that may be imperfections in production and I found none.The leather strap is durable, feels good on my wrist, and is quite comfortable. Even though it is a larger watch, I hardly notice that I am wearing it. And, aside from that, I rather like the design Wenger put into the strap.The crystal is perfect. Viewing the dial is very easy. There is no distortion which I have encountered with some other brands, ie sometimes the viewing angle does not allow for a crystal-clear view. Not on the Wenger. From any angle it is crystal clear. The black outline on the minute and hour hands (along with the red second hand) are very visible.The crown, like my earlier one, is a bit stiff but not overly so. I would much rather have it that way than too loose. With some other brands I have discovered that the crown, due to being somewhat loose, had popped out and my timepiece was no longer keeping time. Or it came loose, the time changed, and the crown went back, but the time was way off. A tighter fitting crown protects that from occurring.Speaking of keeping time, the 72900 is keeping perfectly in synch with my smart phone. It does not seem to miss a minute.This is a sturdy, well-built and accurate timepiece. Definitely highly recommended!(Update Sept 18, 2013: Going on two years now and it is still keeping totally accurate time. I have accidently grazed the crystal on some fairly rough surfaces but there is no permanent damage, it is still clear. The band still looks new, though there is that indentation where the latch and buckle meet the band - but that happens to any leather strap. I remain perfectly happy with this timepiece.)", "label": "very positive"}, {"text": "My wife, being the connoisseur of knee-high socks, absolutely love these.

The friends I made had a quiz they liked to use: \"What do you call a person who speaks three languages? Trilingual;  What do you call a person who speaks two languages?  Bilingual; What do you call a person who speaks one language?  American.I have wanted to improve my language status for many years.  My High School Latin teacher said that after I learned Latin, the other romance languages would be easy.  I considered the other romance languages (Spanish, Portugese, Italian. Aragonese, Aromanian, Arpitan, Asturian, Corsican, Emiliano-Romagnolo, Friulan, Galician, Ladino, Leonese, Lombard, Mirandese, Neapolitan, Occitan, Piedmontese, Romansh, Sardinian, Sicilian, Venetian and Walloon), only the major four (French, Spanish, Italian, and Portugese were attractive to me, but then I saw this offer from Rosetta Stone and I chose French.Learning French was easier than I thought.  Of course the grammar I learned in my four years studying Latin made French grammar easier.  Well, and I did get a French grammar text and a French dictionary, since Rosetta Level 1 is limited in grammar.  After a few months using the interactive program, I began to feel comfortable speaking the language.I was tempted to brag to my family that I now speak French, then I realized that I had yet to converse in French with another human.  Soon I remembered my years living in Germany.  I had studied German, but could not really have a meaningful conversation with a German.  When I said something in German, they would answer in English (somehow they knew I was an American).  Those who did not speak English (maybe one percent of those I encountered) used a different dialect, and I was back to using my German book and pointing to words.  The lesson for me is that now I must spend some time in France if I really want to learn the language.  Oh well, I can read French as long as people do not get technical.Recently I thought of a possible answer to the dilemma I have with my European friends.  I could learn to speak Walloon, Friulan, and Arpitan.  I am unlikely to encounter anyone who speaks those languages, so no one to question whether I really know it.  Then I will tell them I am \"quadri lingual.\".  Do you think that will work? . . .

Wish they made a size 4.5I find that Nine West shoes tend to fit me well, and though they occasionally run a tad wide or long, they are overall pretty true to size and wearable.

I would have exchanged these for a 4.5, but unfortunately most shoe companies are too inconsiderate to make that size.  However, as Nine West turns out a reasonable selection of size 5's, I will give them credit for that kindness.  (Although, I sadly think vanity sizing is inching into footwear and this boot seems to be a victim.)I found the shaft of these comfortably narrow.  I wear these over jeans and they are pleasantly snug over jeans and knee socks.  If you have wide calves, I would not recommend these for wearing over jeans.

In fact I think that this looks more natural than some of the &#34;T-shirt bras&#34; on the market.  I do not like padding in any bra because I do not want to look larger than I am built. The cups in this bra are very supportive. There is stretch lace in the cups and back, which makes it nice that there is no stretch in the straps. This is a perfect balance. If there were stretch straps and stretch lace, your figure would sag.  There is a reason why some bras do not have stretchy straps.  Stretchy straps does not necessarily mean discomfort. The underwire is very supportive, which takes much of the weight off the shoulders.  The straps are firm but soft, easily adjustable, and stay that way.

Pearls seem to be the \"go to\" jewelry for fancy occasions. You can't go wrong with these pearls for an elegant accessory.My wife received a couple compliments when she wore these to a wedding.

I bought a medium, which is supposed to fit shoe sizes 8.5 to 9.5, but these very snugly fit my size 8 shoes, and I can't imagine them comfortably fitting a larger shoe size.2.

These look about as stylish as is possible for a rubber overshoe.5. I have not noticed any \"tire\" smell unless I hold them within about 6 inches from my nose. Since there is no reason to do that, ignore the negative reviews claiming that these will smell up a room. They don't and they won't.6. These are good for wet and muddy surfaces, so long as you are not standing in water, slush, snow, or mud that is more than about an inch deep.

Still it provides for a good comfortable fit.I do like the overall effect of the three smaller dials layout. These dials cover the month, day, and time. Invicta added a date window at the 3 o'clock position as well. The numbers, hands and date box are luminous.Like other Invicta watches, I found that the crystal holds up better then most. Just like similar watches in the company's line, the 350 is equipped with two large buttons along side the crown, and located on the right side of the case. The silver casing is a plus.The watch is a show stopper with one exception. Last night at dinner and in a low light setting, I found it very hard to read the time. The designer dropped the ball by coating the tips of the white hands black.  It just doesn't work with a black face.Like other watches in the Invicta line, the 350 is powered by Swiss quartz movement. Even though, it  looks like a divers watch, thats where it ends. Its not. This model is water resistant up to 330 feet.

But, it also had a lot of features that I never used, was a bit large, and expensive. After I turned 45 I started to have trouble reading and had to start using reading glasses. I found that reading the G-Shock was getting harder and harder. That's when I started looking for a decent digital watch with larger digits. I didn't think I would have a problem and looked at G-Shocks first, only to find that G-Shocks all have small digits and the displays are further complicated by many small flashing things that don't have any true purpose. All I wanted was a decent looking watch with big digits on the display and a simple menu. Every brand I looked at had nothing like this. I was baffled. It seemed that someone should have thought of a simple basic watch for older people that had a larger display. Eventually my search led me to Timex and the 1440 series of watches. I think Timex makes its Sport watches with a bigger display so that athletes can read them while running. Whatever their motivation, the Ironman series and 1440 series had the easy to read display that I needed.For a watch that only cost $15.00 this thing is well thought out! Not complicated at all, a good size, a classic style that works in all but the most formal of situations. The time digits are BIG! It displays the day above the time. If you need the month and day just push the top right button and there it is in BIG numbers. The way the day of the week is displayed is a little odd, having seven tiny three letter abbreviations that are darkened to show the current one. I'd rather have a two letter code that's larger but hey, for the price, what more can you ask?I know G-Shocks are good watches that can take being submerged to ridiculous depths and falls from ridiculous heights, but seriously, the last time I went diving to 20,000 feet after jumping out of an aeroplane I wasn't too worried about the time! The best tools are always the ones that are balanced and this watch is exactly that. It is a good basic watch that tells the time reliably and has a few, very few, additional features that are actually useful. It looks pretty good and is a reasonable size.

At the time I was wearing an Omega Seamaster, which I considered to be a fine watch. The problem was I was a beginning runner and a running friend said that I'd need a chronograph. My Omega just wouldn't do. So, I reluctantly purchased a black plastic Casio chronograph/alarm/beeper watch. I'd always noted people wearing black plastic watches and thought it looked strange. Couldn't they afford a real watch? Well, it wasn't long before my Casio was the timepiece of choice and my Omega was resting at home in a dresser drawer and it's been that way ever since.The precision of the Casio was amazing and I enjoyed the beeper, much to some people's dislike. The chronograph function proved essential to my running and racing enjoyment. The Casio was an amazing timepiece in many different ways. The five-year battery lasted eight years. Finally, after about ten years, the watch itself gave out and I purchased another. I'm now on my fourth Casio, an atomic G-shock, chronograph model that I received as a Christmas present after voicing complaints that the control buttons on my previous ageing Casio had stopped working properly. Okay, I've worn the watch for about 6 trouble-free years.Personally, I prefer the simpler and less expensive Casio models, but one just doesn't say that about a Christmas present. This particular model has features that are of no use to me, a trait common to many electronic products. It automatically corrects the time via a radio signal and never needs batteries. Unfortunately, the \"cost\" of these features is a bulkier watch and I have trouble getting some of my sleeves buttoned on my watch wrist. In any case, it has preformed flawlessly and is most certainly a high-quality timepiece. It's now over six years old. Finally, the belt has given out so It's time to look for a replacement.Casio timepieces are the \"Mercedes\" of electronic watches. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone. I'm not totally satisfied with this particular model for the above-mentioned reasons. There are a myriad of models from which to choose to suit your particular needs and, given the choice, I probably wouldn't have chosen this particular one. Otherwise, it's been a fine timepiece.Gary Peterson", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "This fit so nice and loose I went up a size to have extra room through the thighs, ( I have nice big legs) didn't really need to.

Only the sole has the Nine West logo and size) and the color had bled all over the stuffing. Because of the odd color no way it will go with black/gray.

I'm giving them a 5 because of comfort and style.

The boots were the same,  ie no lining, etc. In store lighting the boots looked like a dark smoke color with a brownish hue. They really are a strange color but they are by far the most comfortable Nine West boots I own. Walked in them all day with no pain or foot fatigue.

This can cause serious back problems, so I had to return it :( I missed a few days from work because of the back pains caused from wearing this bag. Sadly I cannot repurchase this.If you own this and have any back aches, investigate.

I love the silver tilt of the softly rounded watch glass. Unfortunately, it is one of those pretty but useless touches.  When you see a picture of it, the numbers are very clear; however while in use, the watch always has to be tilted one way or another to see the numbers.  This watch is good if you only want it to be pretty and you're going to look at your phone for the time anyway.It's not that big of a problem to tilt the watch to see the time since the watch is always traveling and you already have to bring it around to the front to see the watch face anyway.  That's the really annoying part about it.  Most of the time I am wearing it, the actual watch face is on the outside of my wrist, where it is most likely to get banged up.  On the other hand, so to speak, no amount of banging has caused the watch to get scratched or to go off time.I have been wearing this watch since the day it arrived trying to make it be more flexible.  It has been everywhere during the past two months even to a 7-year-old's laser tag birthday party where it was covered with chocolate frosting and cake.  It has never become softer and more flexible.  The inside of the band is sort of sueded so it is more comfortable.  But then it has the ring of scratchy and annoying leather to catch the end of the band.Because watch bands have never fit me, I have tended to like big dangly watches or stretchy bracelet watches.  My wrist is very small and bands are loose.  To put a new hole in it is to make it fit so closely that it cuts off circulation.  I have never been able to find the right in-between notch that will allow it to stay face up on my wrist and not cut off circulation or to be comfortably loose but not floating all over the place.Of all of the Invicta watches I have tried, this one is the most problematic.

I'm relatively new to the forums but I wanted to start doing a few in-depth watch reviews of my small collection.  This Seiko SNK795 was my very first real watch, purchased just over a year ago in December 2010.  The only watches I had before this were cheap digitals from when I was in grade school.I loved this watch for the year that I wore it daily.  It took some incredible abuse and kept ticking with near perfect accuracy.  Just so you know the watch was not wound during the taking of these photographs.  It still works perfectly though.SpecificationsCase diameter: 38mmCase thickness: 11mmBand width: 20mmWeight: 103.6gI didn't realize at the time how small and light this watch really was since it was my first.  Comparing it now to my Orient Mako, it looks like it could be a women's watch on my 6.6\" wrist.  It has absolutely no heft compared to the Mako; however that's not always a bad thing.  I would only wear it now for special occasions since it's my only \"dressy\" type watch.MaterialsCrystal: Seiko's proprietary \"Hardlex\"Case/strap: Stainless steelI was actually very impressed with the Hardlex crystal.  I was by no means careful with this watch at all.  It was banged off of shelves at work multiple times among other things.  In the entire year that I had it, it only got one permanent scratch.  The stainless steel band has tons of scratches; it looks like it survived a plane crash or something.  I really don't mind if my watches show wear; I only buy affordable and I think it gives them character.Overall AestheticsI bought this as my first watch mainly because of the simplicity.  I really liked the minimalistic style.  Also, at the time I had absolutely no idea what I wanted in a watch.  I didn't really realize that this was a small, dressy style of watch.  I do like the silver reflectivity of the numeral markings.  I really like the subdued crown; it never digs into your wrist.  I also like the fact that the watch is thin.However, over time my overall perceptions of it stylistically have changed.  Although it was my first watch and will always be special because of that, the dressy aesthetic has lost its appeal to me as I'm more of a casual guy.StrapFirst I must say that I've had absolutely no problems with the quality of the stainless steel strap and closure throughout my trials and tribulations with this watch.  It has held it to my wrist like a venerable servant.  The watch was very comfortable on the wrist.  However, once again the Orient Mako completely changed my perspective.  Now this Seiko's strap just feels extremely chintzy, like it could fall apart at any moment.MovementI believe this Seiko uses their 7s26 movement.  I cannot pretend to be an expert on movements; I'm just a novice watch lover.  However, I can tell you from experience that this movement was impeccably accurate.  I daresay you will NOT find a more accurate automatic watch for this price (More on price in a minute).  In the course of the year, I only had to adjust the time about 2 times, and it was only in the first couple months.  In the last 8 months I wore it, it gained +0 minutes.  From what I've now learned about mechanical watches, that's pretty incredible for the price point.Price/ValueI paid $72 shipped for this watch via Amazon.  I really think the entire Seiko 5 line represents an excellent value.  I don't regret this purchase in the slightest, but if I could go back in time I would choose a different model; probably the military style SNK809.LumeThe lume on this watch was incredibly weak, but only because the surface area that was actually lumed was tiny.  Only the hour and minute hands and tiny markings around the outside of the dial had luminescent paint.  It only worked after being exposed to strong light, and only lasted a few minutes.  To be quite honest the lume was so unimpressive it didn't even warrant a photograph.Special FeaturesThis watch is only water resistant to 30 meters, so from what I understand this probably only covers washing your hands.  Fair enough, I would never swim with a watch on anyways.  The day/date window is easily readable.  The best feature this watch had was the display caseback, something I miss GREATLY transitioning to the Orient Mako.  I really enjoyed being able to see the \"magic\" of the mechanical movement at work.  It was really cool to be able to witness the pulse of the watch's heart.  If I ever get another automatic, I will mandate that it has a display caseback.Overall Build QualityNow that I've owned an Orient Mako for a few weeks, I've come to appreciate the added weight.  Everything about it just feels more solid.  But despite the lightness of this Seiko, it proved to be a tank at heart.  It withstood terrible abuse, like being dropped from 4 feet on concrete.Final ThoughtsThis watch made a faithful companion and was an excellent introduction into the wide world of watches.  I would highly recommend a Seiko 5 to anyone new to watches.  My only suggestion is to be prepared to upgrade the strap.  It would really improve the watch tenfold.Overall, you really can't go wrong with Seiko.  Even the cheap models like this one are insanely reliable.  I have come to understand why they are so respected on the forums.", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "I wore the 927's and was sad when I couldn't get them anymore.

The claim of 1000+ possible combination seems to be wildly exaggerated but, with the 3 color crystals, 4 hilt sleeves, 4 end caps and 3 sleeve rings you can probably produce 100+ combinations, many of them hard to distinguish between each other.Assembly is not too hard but you will need a Phillips screwdriver to open and close the battery compartment (3 AA's not included). Once the batteries are in and you insert your favorite color crystal(s) you can have a workable weapon by attaching your favorite sleeve ring, hilt sleeve and end cap.The manual is pretty good at showing how to put the saber together and the several basic models are illustrated.Once assembled, the saber produces the selected light when the handle button is touched and, while the button is pressed, it hums and makes the other familiar saber noises. There is NO motion-sensitive sound generator. The sound comes out when the button is pressed and swinging does not alter the sound in any way I could detect.Overall, it's an improvement over the lesser versions and it can be fun when in the hands of an advanced Jedi learner. It appears to be quite durable, in spite of the cheap-looking plastic the various components are made of. One curious shortcoming is the hilt sleeves being a couple of inches shorter than the hilt itself. This causes them to slide up and down the hilt and, when it does, the sleeve cover's hole that would allow the fighter to push the hilt action button comes out of alignment and the button can't be pressed.The hilt sleeve problem compels me to take away one star. Otherwise, if you discard the obviously inflated promise of 1000+ possible combinations, the kit very much delivers what you would expect for the price.", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "I really like the feel and fit.

The tongue is attached to the sides of the shoe and the entry 'hole' is very limited.  My feet tend to swell and I found I had a lot of trouble getting the shoe on in spite of it actually being too big through the length and width.

The balaclava is perfect for keeping the cold away from his neck & it won't move around like a scarf does.It's also great for those cooler days when riding a motorcycle & fits nicely under the helmet.

As someone with perpetually ice cold feet, I'm miserable without slippers. I've tried just about every kind and hadn't found any that offered both comfort and the right amount of warmth.

For that, my family is truly grateful. They also don't slide off of my feet, and I'm grateful for that. But, even better, they don't make my feet sweat miserably (while still feeling cold) the way bootie-style slippers do. AND the semi-firm sole provides some much needed support and cushion as I discovered while wearing these for a 6-hour cooking marathon on Christmas day.Yes, as some reviewers have noted, they do seem to run small. My feet don't just slide into them; I have to work them on with a finger, but once my foot's inside they're incredibly comfortable. So much so, in fact, that I forget I've got them on.Thankfully, these also look good. I think of them more as \"house shoes\" than slippers for that reason. Since I often wear my slippers while driving my son to school in the morning, I like knowing that I can pop into the store if I absolutely need to (assuming I've changed out of my pajamas, that is).In fact, the reason I'm leaving this review at all is because I'd popped onto Amazon to see how much they cost since I want another pair, perhaps in Toast or that gorgeous blue.

Not only that, but the straps stood about one inch above my foot, and no, the straps are not really adjustable.  They can be loosened, but if you need them tighter, they will only tighten by about 1/4 inch.  So, I sent them back and figured that was it.Then, about a week later, I saw the salmon-colored ones on sale.  I love the color, so I decided to try again.  This time I ordered 8 1/2, and they're a bit snug.  The straps fit, though, and the color is gorgeous, so I kept them.The shoe is very cute, but it looks a little funny on the foot.  They are very low-cut, which means they show a lot of toe cleavage.  Not only that, but the left shoe's strap is sewn on in the wrong place.  It's about 1/4 inch below where the right shoe's strap is located, and it causes the left foot to look a bit mishapen.  All that being said, they are still very cute shoes.I love minimalist shoes--they're all I wear.  These are excellent as far as that's concerned--they have  zero drop, and the soles are thin and flexible.  However, they are not as comfortable as they should be, perhaps because the 8 1/2 is too snug (but the 9 was ridiculously large).  Maybe they sent the wrong size the first time.  I don't know--I sent them back weeks ago.I really wanted to love these shoes, but I can't help but think that Vivobarefoot had problems with them from the beginning.  They don't even show up on their website--the strap issue alone probably caused many buyers to send them back.Do I recommend them?  Yes, but with reservations.  I will wear these when I want a cute shoe and won't be doing a whole lot of walking.  The fit is not terrible, but they do rub.If you can find them for around $30 - $35, they're probably worth it.

However, before I review the positives of this trusted brand, I need a rant:These things are made in China. That, to me, would normally be a deal-breaker but I can't find anything made anywhere else. Why we should fatten the Chinese in this way, send jobs offshore, which my generation called \"outsourcing\", I just don't know any answers. Payless Shoes is just as bad, though you are liable to find U.S.-made shoes there, and some stores are offering shoppers the choice of American-made-only.But that isn't enough. I'd rather consider boycotting these manufacturers and buying from Europe, whence the shipping might cost more than the shoes but at least it isn't betraying my country.With all that off my chest, Nunn Bush shoes are still the man's dream shoe as they were 30 years ago. The materials are still top quality and the workmanship is as close to perfect as one can get with a loafer. The soles are perfect too, in that they are the sturdy, non-slip black stuff which I assume is vulcanized rubber. The heels are extraordinary.An objective complaint: Nunn Bush's oxblood (our haughty new term for \"burgundy\") is just plain brown to my eyes. It is better than getting some blackened shade, but it still is not the typical wine shade I recall from my younger days. As to the leather uppers, they are as thick and stiff as metal sheeting covered in industrial plastic. I'm not so sure that is a good thing, but then it could be a matter of longevity.So whether the shoes survive me or not, I am happy with the excellent fit, which has always been a big issue for me, the comfort ditto, and the classic design that makes you feel more manly when you wear it.So in point of fact do not forget the other two of 'the Big Three' in shoes:Hush Puppies Men's Shelton Slip-OnandRockport Men's Shakespeare Circle Penny Loafer(which are favored by the Dalai Lama and the pope).

It simply works! Having the analog hands automatically sync up with the digital clock, maintenance free, is AMAZING. Most of casio's other budget minded analog-digital combo watches are set independently, you either have to set it with the standard twist dial, or you have to hold a button down forever and watch the minute hand spin around. The way this watch functions is just effortless. The digital display is very small, but well positioned and easily read, except for a few times of the day when the combined minute and hour hands do a good job blocking part of it.Size is good. It's not a small watch, but it is just small enough to fit on small wrists fairly well, and large enough to be well at home on a medium sized wrist, maybe even a large wrist. I have smaller sized wrists, and anything larger than this just starts to look goofy on my hand.My only major complaint is that Casio does not make this watch in a more neutral color. The functionality is first rate, it just lacks the visual versatility to be worn in many situations.

One flip-flop of the Ocean style in red and black broke at the thong part and I had to repair the sandal with Super Glue and part of a scrubbing sponge - not sure how long my repair job will work. The massage beads are larger and harder and positioned differently and the arch support is more elevated, so they take more getting used to and may be too much of a good thing (reflexology) for some. The thong and side parts of the Ocean sandal are attached at the bottom of the shoe. I can't recommend the Ocean style over this Maui style flip-flop. The Maui style wins hands down for construction, comfort and footbed design - not to mention price. (Ocean style retails for $14.99)I am hoping that these flip-flops will last for a while due to the uni-body construction.These sandals are available at CVS for $12.99 regular price and often on sale.The Maui flip-flops are extremely comfortable and a good choice for those individuals who can't tolerate a flat \"Old Navy\" style flip-flop with no support. These have gentle arch support, massage beads, a contoured footbed and elevated toe rest area.These flip-flops fit perfectly with the Futuro compression ankle support (Comfort Lift) that I need to wear right now due to slow recovery from an ankle and knee injury. It's great to know that these flip-flops are a good alternative as therapeutic footwear forhot summer days.April 5, 2012I am still loving these Maui flip-flops and they haven't broken yet. I hadn't worn them during the winter, but now even though it's still a little cool for flip-flops, I am gearing up for warmer weather. Unlike other flip-flops with no arch support, these are wearable for hours at a time - even for those with flat feet. Take it from someone who wears \"pseudo Crocs\" much of the time, these are so much more comfortable. They keep your feet cool and they are perfect for those of us who can't go barefoot. I did make a few additions for comfort since I have very sensitive toes and I don't usually wear thong style sandals. The thong was irritating the skin between my toes, so I wrapped moleskin around each of the thong parts of the sandal and I put some skin-colored moleskin on the footbed in the toe ridge area. It's a good improvement.April 19, 2012I found the Maui style in turquoise at Fort Lauderdale Beach. They are lovely and perfect for summer tropical wear. The only thing that I noticed is that for extended wear on varying surfaces, the arch support and fairly thin footbed is inadequate. As we were walking around Key West up and down sidewalks and on cobblestones, etc., I started to experience foot pain and fatigue and consequently, it just wasn't fun anymore to explore the streets of Key West. Fortunately I found another CVS and purchased a pair of men's brown Surf Okabashi in men's L (size 7/8) for $12.99. The sizing is comparable to the women's M/L. I am not sure why size 7/8 in men's would be considered large, but anyways...these sandals are heavier weight with more rubber between the footbed and the ground, so they can absorb more of hard surfaces - they are also a little wider. The arch support, massaging beads and raised toe bed are more pronounced also, so the Surf sandals immediately rejuvenated my feet and I made it through the rest of a long day and evening of walking. For some, the more pronounced features of the Surf sandal may take some getting used to.My recommendation for all you women out there with temperamental feet (flat feet and swollen ankles) is that you purchase both the women's Maui and men's Surf models in comparable sizes if you can find them. That way you will have both pretty and functional sandals. Both models in soft rubber have very slip-resistant soles. Your feet will thank you.

Small holes form across the midfoot where the toes flex and grow larger over time. It's as if the mesh is brittle and cracks open where the shoe flexes. They appeared in less than 3 months of purchase. The soles wear as expected. Caveat: rope climbs eat these alive. I use the combat wrap rope climb method, and the foam part of the midsole melts and tears away on the descent. Two workouts involving rope climbs ate all the way through the sole to the interior of the shoe. This is indeed a trail-running shoe, so not surviving something they are not designed for is not a surprise. These have carried me through 4 workouts a week for 9 months, so that's not too shabby.

I generally walk between 20-40 miles per week and get about 6 months of wear out of a pair of walking shoes.  My last two pairs of NB wore out from the inside first; my heal wearing holes in both shoe linings.  When I purchased this model, I noted the different inner lining.  I've had these shoes for over a month and have not noted any lining wear.  The shoes fit comfortably but tend to be a little looser then previous NB shoes that I've purchased.  The shoe doesn't slip or cause problems but I just thought I would mention it.  Overall, I like this model, the fit, the quality of materials and hope to get many more miles of wear out of them.Update: I put about 6 months of hard use on these shoes and as predicted, the inner lining went before the outer shoe actually wore out (leather upper separated from the rubber sole).  However, this model has outperformed many of the other New Balance shoes that I've purchased over the years.  Fortunately, I was able to purchase the same color and model once again and hope to get the same comfortable long-term use as the previous shoes delivered.  One thing I've noticed on the second pair is that they fit a little snugger or \"just right\".  I don't know the reason other than slight differences in manufacturing.  One additional thing that I've done differently on this pair is I've upgraded to the SPENCO POLYSORB Total Support Premium Insole.

First, these do run big.  I wear a solid 7.5 in pretty much ANY shoe (though I size up to an 8 in running shoes for long distance running).  I first ordered these in a 7.5, and they fit o.k., but they were pretty long.  Because they also seemed a bit wide, I ordered the size 7 (often the shorter shoes squish my toes because I need a wide toe box).  The size 7 fits great.Second, I have narrow ankles, so the shoes slip just a tad on my heel, but that's just because the strap doesn't come up quite far enough to keep them snug on my feet (this is a common problem for me).  I wish they were a true Mary Jane with the strap straight across.  I may have to have the straps shortened a bit (worth it on shoes this nice).  Other than that, they are super comfortable.  Even though the heel slips a tiny bit, I don't feel like it's going to rub because the inside of the shoe is so soft.  I don't feel like they need to be broken in at all.  The footbed is cushy but not too much.  It seems to provide sufficient support for this type of shoe.I bought these to wear with skirts, dresses, and even jeans and capris.  They are very versatile and will hopefully be comfortable when walking around for a while (I haven't tested this yet).

One more thing; The day of the week changes very slowly, between 12 midnight and about 5 AM, assuming the watch was set in the correct AM-PM sync, otherwise the day of the week will change slowly between 12 noon and about 5PM in which the day of the week window will show a blank window or a foreign language day before it completes the day change to the next day.

How can one item be both bad and good?First of all, why would you buy men's underwear for your daughter?  I would not buy women's underwear for my son.  This is not Victoria's Secret.Light weight, thin, cotton waffle weave pattern.  Almost like gauze.  Completely breathable.  Fits close to the body.  As a base layer, it aids in trapping body heat, while at the same time, allowing moisture to wick away.  This means that you won't get all sweaty.  Accumulated sweat trapped on certain parts of the anatomy will cause itching and chafing.  Not to mention, embarrassing body odor.This is a one size fits all garment.  Depending on your build and stature, it will fit everyone different.  So guys with wide shoulders, broad back, and large pectorals will have a snug upper body with a lot of bagginess in the middle.  Fat guys will have a tight midsection, and baggy everything else.  The fit is as true to size as can be for a generic sizing.  Generic men's sizing.  Made for a man who is medium height with a medium build.  How can you buy men's underwear made for a man of 5'9\" - 6' tall, and then complain that it didn't fit your little girl?  Buy girls underwear for girls.  You don't see me putting on a bra & thong, then complaining about how it doesn't work.  If you're tall or short, you should expect issues with sleeve and inseam length.  If you wear an XL undershirt, then you can wear an XL union suit.  In order to minimize bulk, and maximize warmth and breathing, you may want to go one size down.You could roll up the cuffs at the ankles and wrist for a better fit.  Or simply cut and hem.  The inseam is almost 32\".  If you wear boots, you may want to hem these up to your boot height.  Otherwise, it can create more bulk under your socks and alter the fit and comfort of your boot shaft.  If you work with your hands, the sleeves can create extra bulk that could limit your arm movements.  Try cutting the sleeves into short sleeves, or cut the sleeves off completely.Everybody wants to know about access when you need to use the bathroom.  In an emergency, this garment will add to your disrobing.  If you haven't gotten use to it, precious moments can seem like forever as you are struggling to open the rear.  Be forewarned.  After you manage to locate and deftly manipulate that unseen button, you still have to adjust the garment so that you can use the bathroom without soiling yourself.  You can try wearing this garment with the back unbuttoned, and maybe leaving the fly unbuttoned.  But that won't be very sanitary.  I would suggest that prior to your maiden voyage, you test drive the union suit and get familiar with the points.  Practice makes perfect.Now I like to wear mine when I'm lounging around the house.  At times, I jump up on the coffee table and do a little dance in the middle of the living room.  As far as my girlfriends are concerned, this is my sexy lingerie.  Which again brings me back to my point that the union suit is gender specific underwear.  Don't buy one for your teenage daughter to wear while she's dancing on the coffee table.

I returned them and tried the Clarks Caslynn Lizzie wedge. I gave the Caslynn Lizzie a rave review because they give me the height and fashion I'm looking for, and their like walking on a spongy cloud.I immediately ordered the Caslynn Lizzie in two other colors. I'm not giving up on Dansko, I own eight pairs, but I'm venturing out a bit and finding there are other brands that are meeting my needs and expectations.When it comes to looks the Dansko Frida rocks, but for me the lack of comfort and stiffness was a deal breaker.

My son is a tall and regular build, (not chubby at all) so I got a size bigger so it would be long enough for him. It was perfect. A little baggy, but the lenght was perfect. You still have to put sun screen on their hands and arms to elbow to cover when the sleves move up as they move around, and on legs from ankle to half way up calf too, and the neck and face of course. But that is way better than having to take forever with a wigling and frustrated toddler putting lotion all over them.

The mesh causes all my other shoes to take in water like it was their primary purpose. Where I live, there is water all year round. It comes in the form of morning dew, puddles after a rain fall, snow, or slush. I have another pair of trail running shoes that look almost exactly like the Ghost, but they have not seen much use because of this issue with the mesh. Instead, I have been using my old leather-covered Adidas shoes from 20 years ago with much better results. Now the soles have come off of the Adidas and I needed a replacement shoe that keeps my feet dry.So, the primary differentiator and reason for me to buy this shoe was Element - the Gore-Tex membrane that is supposed to keep your feet dry. After about a dozen runs in fall weather I am happy to report that it has been working so far. The membrane keeps moisture from wet grass and leaves out of the shoes, and my socks remain dry. I am planning to use these shoes with snow shoes in the coming winter, but I don't expect miracles.Still, I am glad to see that shoe manufacturers have found a solution to a problem that they created in the first place by using mesh material on running shoes.Aside from this particular aspect that was important to me, I don't find them very different from other trail running shoes. They have a bit of a bouncy feel, which you may or may not like. For a while I thought that I was a bit slower with these shoes, but that was just temporary. I have not experienced any traction problems on gravel and rock. They are firm and keep my foot stable, which is important when running at night with a head lamp when you don't see every detail of the trail surface.Overall, I am quite happy with the purchase and I do recommend the Brooks Ghost GTX for keeping socks dry when walking or running in wet grass and through wet leaves in New England fall weather.Spring 2014 updateThe Ghost performed flawlessly all winter. I ran in fresh powder, with snowshoes, on ice, and in melting slush. I use the Atlas Speed Gaiter when there is a chance that snow will get in from the top, which happened to be the case a lot. My feet stayed dry or nearly dry in all cases except for when water levels are high enough to spill into the shoe. I put about 350 trail miles on these shoes in 6 months and don't notice excessive sole wear or damage on the shoe. The Ghost is a great winter running shoe.", "label": "very positive"}, {"text": "Soft n breathable good price very comfy. Want to buy a few more now.

The black one was made in the Dominican Republic--it fit much tighter and definitely lost its comfort appeal.  To make matters worse, I paid more for the black one!  I am so sick of clothing companies having a specific product made in different countries.  This is not unique to the bra industry--jeans and pants are notorious for having multiple manufacturing sites depending on the color of the merchandise.

As I am not inclined to wear leggings, but jeans, I found that I preferred to bunch it similar to the way the picture shows. It looks great and stays put, even with the playing around with toddlers I was doing this Christmas.Now, the material is a bit thicker than a lot of Patty shirts, but is also of a material that does not disguise much of what is under it. Hm. What I mean by this is that when I initially tried it on, I was wearing jeans with a belt. The belt was an obvious bulge under the shirt, despite the easy fit. When I actually wore the shirt, I could not wear my belt (my belts are not accessories- they keep my pants up where they belong and prevents gaps), but this wasn't an issue because of the length of the shirt.Also, because of the weight of the fabric (the shirt has a decent amount of actual weight) and weave, the cowl seemed a bit smaller than I expected, though it may be more because the cowl itself wasn't... hm... loose. I almost want to describe the cowl as stiff, but that is not quite accurate. A lot of cowls on shirts tend to move, flow, allow for draping over shoulders, and other such movement and re-placement. The cowl on this shirt does not have that freedom of movement. It stays pretty much in one spot. One of the toddlers caused a spill on the shirt while I was wearing it... just to the side of the cowl on my chest. I couldn't adjust the cowl to cover the spot and have it stay. It kept returning to its original, central position. Not a bad thing, as cowls that flow can get in the way, but if you want to hide a spill on the chest...The shirt was very flattering and very comfortable.

Not something that I have done before, but I'm hoping it will be helpful to someone.  My goal is to provide my personal opinion about fit, comfort and performance.  This is a review about men's underwear though, including thongs, so I am going to try to keep the discussions clinical but informative.  If you believe you may be offended by this topic, please, do not read any further.  Thank you.Every male is going to be built differently, so let me explain my situation and why it became so important for me to find \"the right underwear.\"  I have a 37.5\" hip measurement and a 38.25\" waist (at the belly button) measurement.  All the underwear I have tried is size \"large.\"  I originally tried to wear boxers and boxer briefs, but they became unacceptable in a professional setting.  I switched to briefs, but then found them to be too restricting.  I needed to find underwear that gave me support throughout the day, but also were roomy enough to accommodate my volume.  I honestly believe that male underwear should have a variety of sizes just like women's bras have.  Unfortunately, no man would ever admit that he wears a 38AA underwear, so I guess that isn't going to happen anytime soon. Ha!The seven pairs I will be reviewing are:Hanes Classics Men's 3-Pack Full Rise BriefHanes Fashion Mid-Length Briefs 5-PackHanes Men's Seamless Pouch Brief (Discontinued?)Gregg Homme Men's Black Push Up Padded Thong Size LargeCalvin Klein Men's Body Hip Brief, Black, LargeCalvin Klein Men's Body Thong, Black, LargePapi Men's 3-Pack Cotton Thong In White, White, LargeHanes Classics Men's 3-Pack Full Rise BriefThese are an economical purchase.  They are what I consider to be the average cotton brief.  The pack came in cool shades, none were white.  The waistband and other materials were pretty comfortable.  The crotch on this underwear is designed for a Ken doll though.  My body would not fit comfortably in these.  The restriction caused an asymmetric arrangement which, during certain movements, would be uncomfortable.  The lack of sufficient cup design caused the gussets to remain elevated off of the body, which in turn causes occasional rubbing and irritation to the upper thigh.  Overall, these are \"default underwear.\"  2 STARSHanes Fashion Mid-Length Briefs 5-PackThese are also an economical purchase.  They were better than the previous default underwear in that the materials were even softer, and the waistband was low enough to allow for no underwear to be seen while wearing certain jeans.  Unfortunately, this underwear suffers the same drawbacks that the Hanes Classics Men's 3-Pack Full Rise Brief did; there is just no considerations taken for large male anatomy.  The gussets again, would not lie against the leg, causing occasional irritation, and the material was so restrictive that it caused asymmetric arrangements that were occasionally uncomfortable.  Overall, these are \"better, but not great.\" 3 STARSHanes Men's Seamless Pouch Brief (Discontinued?)So, I found these pairs on Hanes' website some time ago.  They were so comfortable, that I own over half a dozen of these.  They are spandex-like material, and the crotch is cupped to provide a pouch to give support and symmetry.  All the material is very soft and comfortable all over.  Unfortunately, it is not without drawbacks.  Besides being rare to find and possibly discontinued all together, this underwear has an obscenely high waistband.  It easily goes over my belly button and is labeled with a gigantic \"Hanes\" logo right in the front.  Now, I do not have washboard abdominals, so on top of everything, my bellow, however minor, causes the material to roll down.  This causes a very mild discomfort, especially while wearing pants that are tight in the waste.  By prefolding the underwear down, I can make a satisfactory adjustment.  Overall, this underwear has been my \"long-standing favorite.\"  4 STARSGregg Homme Men's Black Push Up Padded Thong Size LargeOkay, first I will say that this is the first thong I have ever worn, so let me give you a man's opinion on just that first.  On occasion, I have had briefs bunch up and it would require me to make a wardrobe adjustment.  Typically this would be important while wearing professional or evening dress attire, and would involve positioning myself near a wall and doing a slight shift dance so it doesn't look like I'm \"just picking.\"  Now, when I first wore the thong that is the same feeling I had.  I felt compelled to shift and adjust in an attempt to fix my garments.  After some hours of wearing it though, it began to feel more natural.  While walking, the thong feels just fine.  If anything, it feels most uncomfortable while sitting.  If I do an extreme slouch, it feels fine, and if I sit up all prim and proper, it feels fine.  Slouching, just a little though, makes the material tighten down on my coccyx, which causing unfamiliar discomfort.  Being forced to sit up more straight was not something I expected from a thong design.  Now, the rest of the underwear, on the hips and waist, is quite comfortable.  The material is rather thin, but nothing roles down.  Everything stays where it should.  Finally, the crotch design: this underwear has a padded cup, which I was expecting to be something ridiculous, but in actuality, it is quite sensible.  It reminds me of the form material in a bra.  Not so much padded to give you the illusion of extra size, but more preformed for shape.  It feels akin to wearing a costume, like a codpiece.  My body is comfortably symmetric within the cup.  My only complaint is that the cup is not large enough to retain my volume and keep the gussets on the skin.  Again, I have that occasional irritation when the thigh meets the gusset.  If the cup was larger, it would be perfect.  For a man of a different shape, this underwear may be perfect.  Overall, I would say these are \"new and interesting, but could use improvement.\"  4 STARSPapi Men's 3-Pack Cotton Thong In White, White, LargeAlright, here I have the Papi set.  These win out over the Gregg Homme in multiple ways.  1.) They come in a three-pack for about the same price.  2.) They are significantly more comfortable!  3.)  The pouch is much larger.  The gussets lay flat and do not shift.  Everything is held in place quite nicely.  I love them!  There is one bad thing though.  They are ugly!  Definitely look like a jock strap or a weird pair of whitey-tighties.  So comfortable though!  I never once thought about them, from the moment I put them on and went about my day.  They were perfect.  They will make great everyday wear.  Overall, I would say these are \"everyday underwear.\" 4 STARSCalvin Klein Men's Body Thong, Black, LargeThese are almost as comfortable as the Papi brand.  They definitely look better than those jock straps.  Unfortunately the Calvin Klein are sold in singles.  They have all the same benefits that Papi have in fit and comfort, but I can feel the back a bit more.  It isn't bad.  Just kind of there, you know?  Overall, I would say these are \"the evening wear underwear.\" 4 STARSCalvin Klein Men's Body Hip Brief, Black, LargeWell, this Calvin Klein was not what I expected.  It is a cotton brief with a very well defined and comfortable pouch.  The waistband is great; in fact, all over, the underwear is comfortable.  The problem is the backside is too voluminous.  I don't have a backside like a linebacker, but my bum isn't flat as a board either.  The underwear is formed to fit a much rounder bottom, and so it is exceptionally saggy.  They are definitely not for dress pants.  I'm wearing them with kakis, and they seem to be okay.  These pants are not the tightest I have.  Definitely wouldn't want to wear them with tight pants unless you want a bunchy diaper effect.  These would probably be very comfortable with jeans while doing manual labor.  In fact, I have to say that comfort is the number one plus with this pair.  Unfortunately, they are not cheap, being sold only in singles.  Overall, I'm pretty disappointed in them.  If they were half the price or if you have a lot of booty, these underwear will be a good buy.  They have quality, just not shaped properly for me.  Overall, I would say these are \"overly expensive work underwear.\" 3 STARSSo, there we have it!  I was really hoping the CK Hip Briefs would have replaced my \"long-standing favorite\" but I'm surprised to see that award going to the Papi 3-Pack.  They are definitely the most economical/comfortable combo.  They do lack quite a bit of style, so I wouldn't wear them for an evening out.  The CK thong has the most style, sacrificing a little comfort and a lot of coin.  The Gregg Homme was definitely the most gimmicky.  Having never worn a thong before, it does not give a good first impression.  It isn't nearly as comfortable as the others.  It wasn't so bad that I would throw them out outright, but I won't be buying another pair.  The Calvin Klein Hip Briefs were the most disappointing.  They feel great and fit well in the front, but the back is just horrible.  I won't be buying any more anytime soon.  Maybe after rounding out the posterior with some squats.  The three Hanes underwear pairs are definitely out.  The seamless pouch is hard to find and the waistband is way too high.  The other two are just not comfortable unless you're a Ken doll.  The Papi are definitely going to be the next ones on my wishlist.  I'm pretty satisfied with them, and I could see them being my everyday underwear.I hope this review was helpful to someone.  Every man is going to be different, so I wanted to give enough detail to help you decide.  None of these pairs were of \"bad quality,\" they just have their little pros and cons.

Many people associate diver's watches with rotating bezels (to show remaining air) and Invicta certainly makes many watches like that. But with Russian Diver watches, the dials are large and spartan. Originally, they didn't even have second hands, making this one more like the SUV of watches. Most drivers may never take SUVs off the road, but they have the capability. And this watch may be great for diving, but many buyers will wear them just to make a bold statement. But if you ever find yourself in murky water, the oversized dial will certainly help.When people say the watch is large, you expect a large watch. But you should expect this one to be larger than you expect it to be, even though you are expecting it to be large. The primary photo of the watch at the time I wrote this review showed the watch tilted slightly to the left. So the stem appeared proportionally larger. The stem cover is large enough to make a tire valve cover seem small, and the watch looks even larger compared to the stem than it does in the photo.If not for the warranty, I'd give the watch five stars. The watch comes with a standard one year warranty, and can supposedly be extended to five years free of charge for Amazon customers. But the company says you must pay $28.00 (for S&H;) to get it repaired.  By law, a warranty with such a condition must be 'conspicuously designated a \"limited warranty\".' But they don't call it that. It doesn't cost that much to ship a watch, handling is part of the repair process, and full warranties aren't allowed to have shipping charges.The watch is big, robust, has \"Swiss parts movement,\" and is likely to last a long time.  For a watch style that's supposed to have a hour and minute hand, has markings every 2.5 seconds, and has no date or chronograph, you don't have to worry about the details inherent in a watch that's somehow more polite. If you want something understated, don't let the simplicity of a three hand design fool you. This is not a piece of fine jewelry.

Anything OTHER THAN a spinner would not be considered. I also wanted something lightweight so that I could lift it into the overhead. I was specifically buying this bag for short, weekend-ish trips involving plane travel.A friend of mine who works as an IT consultant and flies weekly recommended Ricardo Beverly Hills. I had seen her using a Ricardo spinner (different from this one) when we were in an airport together recently. After some research, I decided to go with this bag, and I am not disappointed!!!First, I love the hard sides. It gives me some confidence that this bag will hold up. Secondly, the spinner function is SO FANTASTIC. I have used the expander and not used the expander and find that the bag does not tilt or fall over. In fact, it is very sturdy when it's standing up and I do not worry about it toppling over. I tried to concentrate on putting heavier items towards the bottom of the bag when packing, but ultimately that went right out the window when I had to figure out how to stuff all of my things into it.It doesn't LOOK like a big bag when you open it up. I initially thought &#34;Good God, how am I going to get anything in here?&#34; Yet, with some creativity and my puzzle skills (*snort*) I was able to fit everything in for a long-weekend trip.As to the weight of the bag, no problem. My bag was STUFFED to the brim with my things, and yet I had no difficulty whatsoever lifting it into the overhead bin. I got the usual &#34;Do you need any help with that?&#34; offers from several gentlemen (thank you, guys!) nearby and I happily responded &#34;Nope!&#34; as I lifted my Ricardo bag into the overhead with ease. Speaking of the overhead, it fits great! No problem at all. It slid right in to the overhead bins on two Delta flights while other people were pushing and shoving their bags in. The ease of use and lightweight factor are the two things I love the most about the bag, besides the spinner feature.After roughing through several flights and numerous overhead bins, the bag still looks pristine. I also really love the different storage spaces on this bag. The inside has a mesh compartment which is perfect for smaller items, and then of course it also has the shoe compartments.This was definitely more than worth the price I paid for it and I loved the bag so much that I went ahead and bought the large 28-inch spinner to match it!

But then the leather started to conform to my foot (as it should really), and by the end of the long day my shoes were falling off my feet due to being just that little bit too big.  I will not grade the shoe down for this because that is a normal effect.I ordered the navy blue and I agree with another reviewer that it is more black than blue.  In the bright sun I could tell that it was indeed blue, but it's very very dark.  I like the color, so that's not a negative either.The sole is nice and soft, so they are not slippery even at first as so many flats are.Overall I love the shoes.  I am sad that I can't wear them any more since they are really a half size too big which makes them fall off when I walk.  But that is my fault, not the shoes.

Then they become really comfortable.", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "UPDATE: I've used these bags for several trips now, and I've stopped using my other ones entirely. These bags hold a LOT of groceries. I went in with four of them today and told the bagboy to use paper when he ran out of room in the Envirosax bags. I had a lot of groceries, too. One bag was full, two were lightly packed, and the fourth was empty! Very, very nice bags! I don't bother rolling them back up; I just tuck them all into one of the bags and leave it in the car to grab and go.I've been using the reusable bags that clip onto the sides of a grocery cart (two to three to a cart) for a year now, combined with a hodgepodge of different reuseable bags, including cloth produce bags, freebie canvas bags, and Acme Workhorse bags. I'm going to compare these Envirosax bags to my Acme bags--the ones that are like plastic bags but are made out of ripstop nylon--but first let me share my experience with reusable bags in general.I use the cart bags to figure out what will fit into the bags I have. I'll fill them up in the cart, carefully balancing products based on weight and smushability, so theoretically the bagger could repack the bags the way I did and I could then walk out without having to use any paper or plastic bags at all. Well, it never works that way. There is always confusion at the checkout counter. Nine times out of ten, I wind up with far too much weight in one of the bags, which strains the seams and has busted out the bottom of a few of my cart-clip bags. The bagger will be asking me if he can put something into a plastic bag as I'm trying to empty out a bag to give him to keep packing with. I buy a lot of groceries at one time, so this may not be as big of a problem for those who don't.The answer, I realize, is to use smaller bags within the larger bags that can be quickly emptied and repacked, perhaps with one bag held empty to hand to the bagger up front, before any other bags are emptied. As I write this, this sounds really confusing, even with me being able to see it in my mind's eye, so forget what I said. But if you've ever tried to shop with reuseable bags, you probably kind of know what I mean.Anyway, first, the Envirosax are going to be perfect for this bag-in-bag purpose. They are about the width of the cart; two or three, depending on how full I pack them as I shop, will fit inside my cart bags. (If I didn't already have the cart bags, I would just sit them in the cart; five would fill up the cart, for sure.) (Of course, if I didn't so enjoy being such a control freak, I'd just load up my cart and hand all the empty bags to the bagger! To each her own....)Now, to compare the Envirosax with the Acme Workhorse bags. The Acme bags are designed to fit over the plastic bag holder for efficient bagging. I doubt the Envirosax would work as well for that because of their larger size, but that's the only thing the Acme bag has over the Envirosax. The Envirosax bags are (I'd say) about a third to half again as large as the Acme bags. The fabric of the Envirosax appears stronger, and so do the seams. Both are double-stitched, but the Envirosax stitching is better. Both are made in China (natch). I think before I use mine too much, however, I'm going to take the time to further reinforce the seams by slip-stitching them along the folded side seam, which will REALLY make them strong. I tend to overload my bags, so I'm just protecting my investment.Knowing me, I'm not likely to bother much with folding these back up to put into the little carrying case, but the case is very nice and tiny and would certainly fit tidily into a glove compartment, briefcase, or purse. Each bag, too, has a neat little band with snap closure to keep them rolled up when not in use. I'll probably just throw mine inside my cart bags as I put groceries away and keep it all by the door. I've been fairly good about taking my bags with me, but those who need extra help will find the Envirosax pouch to be a great boon.Oh, and they look super-fashionable, too, if you're into that sort of thing. The handles are long enough to sling over a shoulder, so they can double for all sorts of things, not just groceries.", "label": "very positive"}, {"text": "I bought this for my teenage daughter and I went with a small since it looks like it would be a man's shirt due to the picture.

Finally, I can wear a G-Shock to work, without feeling like some punk kid. ;)+ Bracelet links are held in place with small spring bars, not friction pins like on most bracelets.

It should also be displayed in the bottom of the display for World Time, Stopwatch, and Timer screens, IMO.- Champaign-colored parts that connect the watch head to the bracelet don't match either part. This is weird, but not a deal-killer for me.- 'ADJUST' button requires a VERY hard, continued push to work.- I would like to see the 'return to home' functionality re-introduced into Casio's modern digital watches. The old one, such as the CA53W calculator watch, and the 5600C G-Shock had this feature. How it works is that if one makes a change or uses one of the sub-features (for example, starting the stopwatch) then the next press of the MODE button takes me back to the home screen.

The manual is so tiny that it requires reading glasses to read. Pages are so small that you can go blind trying to read it. Even worse are the many multiple steps required to just set the time. Casio needs to include a quick start sheet written in normal size print so people can actually see it. Setting the time should take no more than 5 minutes maximum! The lesson learned here is to always buy a watch in person where you can try it out in the store. I've used many watches of this type and usually figure it out in a few minutes (sometimes without the need for the manual). There are too many unnecessary features that this watch has which may only be useful if you can read it. Furthermore, you need clear simple step by step instructions. Unfortunately Casio does not provide readable or clear instructions. As a result, it makes the watch useless (for me at least).The main problem is that Casio got caught up trying to include too many multiple features (most of which are unnecessary).

I have normal width feet, my mom has always said they are narrow, but I don't particularly think so.  I can wear a 9 and a 9.5 and the size 10 was too big.

A truly great boot for $30 and I'm so glad Amazon is offering them. Do they look fake? Well it just depends... it depends on the girl... and by that I mean it depends on how you wear it. If you style it right these can look great and look like an expensive pair of soft leather boots. However, styling aside, upon close inspection you can certainly tell they're pu leather.

These are often high end items; however the purpose of the vinyl coat process is that less than perfect leather can be ground to a perfect surface, painted and the coated with vinyl for a chic and attractive look.  For this type of leather, just several swipes to cover the shoe with a thin coat of Tarrago self -shine with restore a beautiful shine and look of newness to the shoes.

The actual color/wash was close this time, but it looked more contrived then in the pictures. This is fairly typical and it wasn't that far off, this time, but it would have been better if it didn't look like someone had accidentally left a belt sander on them.Another reason I purchased them was because this particular color/wash offered a heavy fabric weight of 12.5 ounces, which doesn't compare to Levi's of the past, but is heavier then many offered today. This is the same fabric weight offered for most shrink-to-fit models, but even though I knew it would seem less heavy due to all the distressing and washing, I'm still amazed by how much lighter they seem compared to my STF's, even after my STF's are well worn and have no starch left in them. And yet, they're still heavier then most colors/washes of pre-washed 501's, and better too, in my opinion.The fit is quite good, although they seem a little roomier then in the past.

This isn't a problem for the waist, but unlike washed STF's, the inseam is about 2\" too long.

I have worn it almost daily since I bought it, and I couldn't be more pleased. Allow me to explain why this is the cincher to buy.1)The difference between corsets and cinchers: I own both, and they both do different things even though most people think that they're the same. A corset makes the body look beautiful outside of clothes (they push the breasts up very high and pull in the waist), but in general (unless you're wearing Marie Antoinette style clothing) they don't look good under an outfit. The breasts become a single lump and the ties are usually quite visiable underneath (which defeats the entire purpose of trying to get people to think that this is your natural figure). A cincher is made to be worn under clothes, to pull in the waist, and to be as invisiable as possible. Therefore they often aren't as pretty as corsets but make much better undergarments.2) Rago rocks! I own many shaper garments, and Rago's are by far the best. Yes, you can find cheaper brands in the department stores, but they won't hold up as well and they won't have the power that Rago's have.3)Of the versions Rago offers on this site, this one is the best. I own the other model which is very similar except that it is lace and has garters, but it doesn't offer as much support as this one and aren't as invisiable as this one. The satin feels wonderful next to the skin and even under clingy dresses this is just about undetectable. Unless you have your heart set on garters, this is the cincher to buy.4) The fit: like many women I suffer from \"Mummy Tummy\", the horrible price one must pay for having grown two human beings in her body. I am in very good shape, but nothing gets those muscles back to their prepregnancy shape besides surgery (I don't have a spare $20,000 lying around and the scar is huge and ugly). This garment instantly takes 2-4 inches off of the waist and allows one to wear fashionable clothes again without looking frumpy or silly. Another bonus is that I stood about two inches taller because it forces you to walk and sit with perfect posture. This gave me back my youthful waistline. One reviewer said that the fit is a bit tight and they run small; the fit is much tighter than what lace materials and cheaper brands offer but that's because it's a high quality product that works! Those satin panels really pull you in, but they're not uncomfortable (I felt like a sausage for the first hour I wore it, but the body heat warms it up and makes it softer without losing any control). I plan on losing about 10-20 lbs. over the next few months so I will probably buy a new one soon, but I'd recommend buying your size according to the chart. Most of the time I can fit into a small because they don't provide as much compression, but this one you need to be exact.Anyway, if you are looking for an awesome waist cincher that is affordable, flattens your stomach and gives you a lovely \"wasp's waist\", and feels wonderful and comfortable next to the skin, this is the one to buy.", "label": "very positive"}, {"text": "These are so comfortable.

So I took away one star since I can't wear these at all while working out, but they are great for around the house and running errands, as long as you don't bend over or just wear a tunic!Update:  I purchased a second pair, and the material isn't as soft or streatchy!!!  I am bummed, I love the softness of my first pair.  They still fit, and I'm hoping they soften with wear.

So I put the Teva shoes back on and walked another quarter mile. Wow, they just kept getting better. Then I kept them on for the rest of the afternoon. They were so comfortable. I felt like I was walking on air. This is very unusual for me. I have terrible feet.So I have a shoe that is nice looking, comfortable out of the box, and a good color.

The strap (one piece) goes under the watch making it easy to replace/switch - also lets you have the watch position asymmetrically on the band.The clarity and readability of the watch face is excellent - the contrast of the hands (I have the black and white face) is outstanding.  The hands are not too thin.  The glow light really works with this watch as the black hands and numbers stand out. I have some Timex watches that just kind-of offer a smuge in the dark when lit - hard to read what the time is, not so on this one.  the red stepping second hand shows well too.The diameter (38mm) is as shown on the site - for me, I find 40mm to be a sweet spot for my wrist size.

The one main zipper pocket inside isn't very large, maybe around 7-8&#34; in length x 4&#34; deep, and the other is just your average little side interior zip pocket that you find in every purse you see. There are two other little slip pockets on the other side of the interior, but again, they are not very large. One is a perfect size for a pack of cigarettes, and the other is about 2/3rds of that..So what you're left with is a large open space with a slightly small top opening, but the bag is functional and attractive despite falling short of my expectations in the compartment department. I like the woven straps and the material is solid and doesn't seem like it will fall apart on me in a months time. The fact that it doesn't flop open and show everyone what's inside like my old purse did, gave it bonus points right from the start and frankly, it's a good looking bag.If you don't need a bunch of interior organization, and you want an attractive, inexpensive bag, then this bag is for you. I love it, and despite not having more compartments inside, I don't have any problems locating things since the bag doesn't lay all floppy and such.

It's mostly onyx, so it's interesting that freshwater pearl gets first billing. However, there are a two things with this product that make me give it 3 stars:1) The beads are not individually knotted. This means that if the necklace were to break, beads would go everywhere and, given the number, would likely be difficult to locate all of them. At some point, every necklace on a string needs to be restrung, since the string breaks down over time with body fluids, exposure to various chemicals, and especially withe motion. Endless necklaces, which tend to be wound multiple times around the neck or knotted into a pattern, experience a lot more stress and wear/tear than a standard 16-20\" necklace. Even if worn at the full 30\" length, there is a greater potential of getting the necklace caught on something. This all means that endless necklaces are more likely to break.2) The beads are tightly strung and give the necklace an uneven appearance. Even zooming in on the picture, you can see that there are beads that are not lying uniformly. From a distance, the necklace definitely looks better than close-up.However, the current price ~$44 may make it worth it regardless, as it can be difficult to find even quality costume jewelry for that.", "label": "neutral"}, {"text": "This was a really good purchase, I recommend it in a 100%.

This new generation of ColdGear is much lighter and the material is softer, but it keeps me warm.  When I walk to the gym in the winter, this is all I wear for a top, no jacket, hoodie, or anything else, just this and it keeps me warm.  I have been stopped coming from and going to the gym on 10 degree days by people asking me if I was crazy.  I replied that I wasn't and it was the truth.  This top seals in the heat, wicks the sweat, and keeps you warm.  Whether you are training indoors or out, this top rocks.

I have a very wide ball of foot (front foot), and an every narrow heel.  Because of that I can only wear a size seven in almost any shoe.  If I get a half size bigger (7 1/2) my shoe will instantly turn into a flip flop.  If I get a half size smaller the ball of my feet get squished and I end up with fold lines on my foot.  OUCH!  My foot length is a solid size seven so it all works out.Okay so having read the reviews here and knowing my foot irregularities I decided to partially take the advice of the other reviewers here and order 1/2 a size bigger rather than an entire size bigger.  I was surprised to find that the shoes were exactly half a size too big.  I decided to try them out anyway and took them to my Zumba class.  It was there that I realized that the half size makes a big difference.  These are dance shoes.  They are made to fit tight like a glove (think ballet).  Your toe  big toes should rest comfortably against the front of your shoe.  (These are made to be able to dance on pointe - on the tip of your toes).  If you go too big on these shoes they will not fit right and will be extremely uncomfortable.  I found myself readjusting my foot in the shoe trying to find that sweet spot for comfort only to slip out of it again.  I left dance class with achy feet.Amazon's wonderful exchange policy made quick work of getting a new pair of shoes to me (thank goodness for Amazon Prime's two day delivery). The size sevens fit like a glove.  The tight fit ensures arch support, and ensures that my foot is always on the cushion parts (love it).  My knees no longer ache (due to the lack of traction on the shoes), my feet are cushioned against the jumps we love to do in Zumba (thanks to the thick sole under the ball and heel of the foot), and I have great cute hot pink and black shoes.If you are unsure of your size, I suggest getting the shoe in the closest fit and the half size over or under it (whichever you think will most likely fit).  Put them on in class (to avoid messing up the bottoms and allow you to return them with ease) and see which size fits you best.I know some people like to wear their shoes a half size or so larger for comfort.*****If you like your shoes to fit loosely, do not get these shoes.

They are beautiful, and are not just a cheap knockoff, they are durable and, well just splendid.", "label": "very positive"}, {"text": "I purchased another corset by this brand (from Alivila. Y Fashion) few weeks ago. I was so pleased with the quality, I decided to purchase several more. I went to the store's website to see what other styles they offered. You can't beat the price and the quality. I have purchased several corsets for 3-4 times the price from a well known lingerie company, and the quality is comparable. I saw this corset listed as one they sell. So, I decided to buy it on Amazon (instead) from Bslingerie, because I'm a prime member (amazon fulfilled this particular order). So, I received it in 2 days. I'm not quite sure who actually makes (manufactures) these corsets, however, many of the large lingerie companies are selling the exact same corsets. The first corset I bought from this manufacturer had a more detailed size chart, instead of the vague size chart Bslingerie has listed. Here are the sizes from Alivila. Y Fashion for this same corset:S/Bust:29-31inch Waist:23-25inchM/Bust:31-33inch Waist:25-27inchL/Bust:33-35inch Waist:27-29inchXL/Bust:35-37inch Waist:29-31inchXXL/Bust:37-39inch Waist:31-33inchI bought an XL (based on my measurements), and it fit like a glove. It's very important that you do your measurements before choosing a size. Your waist measurement is the most important. The measurements Alivila Y. Fashions had listed are fairly accurate for this corset. Just like the other reviewer stated, when you measure your bust, don't use your band size. Measure your diameter including the breast. If there is a large discrepancy between your bust and waist measurement, and you don't fall in one particular size (or even close), you may have a difficult time choosing something that fits. In that case, you may want to choose the size based on your waist measurement. However, the lacing in the back won't be even, and there may be a substantial gap at the top of the corset. Obviously, this won't fit everyone perfectly. I could have gone with the L, because both of my measurements fell into a L or XL (based on the size chart I listed above). However, I opted for the XL, since most people were saying that it ran small. I'm glad I did. I'm not sure what the protocol is for sizing, when it comes to waist training. I am able to tighten it a couple more inches, if I want to. Of course, if I did that, I wouldn't be able to breathe! I bought the purple. The purple wasn't what I expected. I was expecting a neon purple (more of a periwinkle). Instead, it's a muted purple with a little more red than blue. It's still very stunning. It has black trim. The fabric is brocade, but it looks more like lace in the photos. The matching thong leaves something to be desired. The fabric used to make the corset is a little too stiff to make a thong out of, and it's very large for me. I'm not complaining. The eyelets are a little difficult to close. I have to close them first, then adjust the corset by tightening it in the back. It's very easy to adjust the back, compared to other corsets. I'm not sure how to wash it, because there are no instructions. I'm assuming I will hand wash it with a very mild detergent. I don't know how well these will hold up for waist training and daily wear. These corsets don't look cheap. They would be nice to wear for special occasions with a wrap, for bride's maid attire, lingerie, or costume play.

I did notice that the black pair was missing the engraved \"RB\" on the back of the left lenses. I don't know why.2. Polarized: The polarized feature doesn't bother me at all in reading LCD screens, nor does it improve the view much (it cuts out a little more light, but not much difference).3. Sizing: I am a small guy and have narrow face. The 52mm is definitely for children: a bit tight (even for me) and looks like a toy; The 55mm looks great, although i feel they can be loose sometimes (look good, but wear loose). I strongly recommend 55mm if you have to get these, unless you are buying for your kids.4. Looks: They both look great, but I prefer the tortoise ones that are a little bit different but not too special. Another thing to note is that other people can see your eyes more easily through the ordinary lenses than the polarized lenses.5. comparison to the OriginalWayfarer (2140): later I got a pair of 2140 (Original Wayfarer, 54mm, tortoise color) for my cousin. The Original Wayfarers are a bit more expensive, but feel they are of better quality: stronger metal hinge, thicker and heavier plastic.

The 70-200mm f/2.8L IS will just fit in the compartment with the lenshood reversed. However, the mounting end sticks \"up\" a little more than I would really like. The biggest thing I noticed was a lack of padding in the top flap, I can \"feel\" the endcap on the 70-200 through it. There is a zippered inside pocket on the flap, so I'll probably insert a piece of thinsulite or thin foam in it to give it just a little more padding on top as a \"comfort\"I fit the above lenses, the 2x teleconverter, 430EXii Flash, and accessories inside the main compartment.

There are golden bars on the sides of the bikini to adjust the level of skin showing on the side.

You do have to keep pulling the bar back to keep the strings closed because after awhile the strings will spread by themselves. That&#8217;s just a bit of advice if the bikini leaves you feeling a wee bit over exposed. I can wear the bikini either way, but prefer the closed sides. My only issue with this swimsuit is that the straps that go on the top of the bikini are not attached. You actually have to sew the back of the strings to the bikini. There is a slot to slide the string in so you can sew it to the suit, but that&#8217;s a bit too much for me.

It's an ugly light muddy yellow. the bag actually said both wheat and light yellow but since I've got the light yellow one I know it's not the same. I still love the skirts but think azules really needs to be required to update the colors, too many of them are way off from the pictures. Lots of the colors are also so close to each other that only holding them up next to each other can you actually tell they are different.  My husband asked me why I bought so many duplicates when actually it's just yellow and light yellow are so close and coral and tangerine are so close and salmon and red orange are so close.  Baby blue, eggplant, rust, light yellow, dark teal and obviously wheat are very off from the color depicted in the pictures and about half are slightly off.  I feel a bit taken advantage of having the colors be so misleading but decided to keep all but the wheat as I figure having close duplicates just means they will last longer because they get less wear.

Waterproof Windproof Insulated Work GloveWith the weather we've been having around here, the gloves that I had just didn't give me the protection that my hands needed.  With temperatures in the single digits and lower, (the wind chills are what you have to worry about), you need a pair of gloves designed to function in these weather conditions. Built to work as hard as you do, the waterproof and windproof WB Glove will keep your hands warm and dry in severe weather conditions.Another thing is dexterity, you need a pair of gloves that you can move your fingers without much difficulty and a fix that will... fit like a glove. A glove that is fit like it was a part of your hand.  You get both protection and fit with these gloves and that is important.  If you use your hands in the cold, you need a glove that will be able to accommodate both fit and function.Carhartt is a name that you can count on to deliver a product that will do the job without falling into pieces. A feature that is of interest is the palm material wraps around the finger tips improving your grip and adding durability. I strongly recommend these gloves.Some of the product features are:* Shell: 100% Polyester; Palm: 100% Polyurethane; Lining: 100% Polyester* Hand Wash* Dura-Dry waterproof, windproof, breathable insert* Reinforced polyurethane palm, nose wipe, hook & loop cuff, wrap caps* Made in ChinaOne thing to remember about these gloves is that the sizing runs small.  I have large hands and the XXL was a tight fit.  I normally can get away with a dress glove that is XL, but these do run on the small side. If you are buying these for yourself or a spouse get a size larger and they should fit perfectly once you break them it you shouldn't have any problems.Another thing is the balance between your normal hand moisture and your glove.  Some gloves just make your hands sweat, but these are a great balance, stayed warm and didn't have wrinkled hands when I was done. I imagine they are made like other Carhartt things and will last for a long time. Comfy, warm, functional.

It's formal enough to wear on a night on the town and casual enough to wear at work or any social function. Paired with a cute pair of legging, stockings, or tights, this dress is versatile.I would suggest getting it maybe one size bigger to be on the safe side.", "label": "very positive"}, {"text": "great for little ears or even big girls love the sparkle  get for  sensitive ears  post were slightly bent  but still work out", "label": "negative"}, {"text": "I really liked these shoes, but found them to be too tight.

I repurchased in larger size because I felt needing a bigger size was the only problem. I have bought so many jeans over the years that I can tell you, I am very fussy, and I knowwhat works and what doesn't for me. I found the material to be rather scratchy. There was a gap at the back of the waist, which apparently was the price I'd have to pay for them to fit around my hips. This is such a common problem. After a few hours of wear, they felt like they were beginning to fall down; however, it is worth noting there was no bagging out of the knees or rear, just this uncomfortable feeling of them sliding down, which was very odd as they are described as sitting at the waist. Also, these have some polyester in them, which I feel is a good thing for shape retention, but maybe that had something to do with the sliding. I think these jeans would have worked better for me if I was not overweight. Also, I felt the petite length was perfect for me at 5'2. As I said, I pretty much know what works for me, and that would be &#34;pajama jeans.&#34; I was hoping for some &#34;real&#34; jeans to fit well and be comfortable. The search continues, or maybe I will stick with the pajama jeans. There are so many choices of Lee Jeans offered on Amazon, maybe there is one for me, but it would take luck to find it.", "label": "neutral"}, {"text": "My nephew will love this present for christmas, he will be so happy and so will I.

I got the transparent body with orange sole and laces; size 8.5 USA, on the bottom it says 40. Like the other reviewers said, I suggest opening them outside and leaving them there for a little while- because they do smell a strongly. Be careful if you are prone to headaches, the smell might give you one. The transparent body was a little cloudy and they do fog up when you wear them without socks. It seems like good quality plastic/rubber, they come without the laces laced up, so you can adjust them to your fitting. The outside sole looks good and durable, hopefully they are waterproof as they say (haven't tried yet). The inside sole it flat, and the tongue, as many other said, is attached to the body. I suggest also to wear high socks, because if you tie the laces tight, they do scuff your leg, maybe causing blisters.

If you are short and have thin legs, this will fit well, but if you are taller than 5'5&#34; (I'm 5'9&#34;) than I do not recommend you buy this.

The leather palm helps me hold the camera securely.  They're also nice and warm.  Very happy with these gloves.  Also nice that there's a cover for the finger tips, when I need it.  Update:  December 17, 2011 - had to take pictures outside on a cold, windy day and these were just terrific at keeping my fingers warm while allowing me to operate the small camera buttons.  I do have another much lighter weight pair of tipless gloves and they just don't keep my hands warm.

Getting them on seemed more difficult than a slip on shoe should be, even with a very thin sock on.  Once on, they were tight.  I only tried on one shoe then packed them up and sent them back.

I would recommend ordering one size smaller than your actual size.  I bought the small, and it fits more like a medium or large.  Which is fine since I bought this to wear around the house or to sleep in.The shirt is very soft and comfortable.  The &#34;burn out&#34; look is less pronounced than in the photo, though, and this finish a little duller.Being as I am petite and this is long, the &#34;pocket&#34; area falls below (instead of over) my stomach, which makes this much more flattering that it would have been if shorter.", "label": "positive"}, {"text": "I am a 36D/36DD depending on the bra.
